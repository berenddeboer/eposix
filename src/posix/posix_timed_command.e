	description: "Class that can execute something that should take %
	%X seconds to complete. If it takes more than X seconds, the command is%
	%terminated and execute returns False."

	idea: "Inherit from this class and implement do_execute."

	known_bugs: "VE doesn't deliver an exception on SIGALRM or does something weird, so this class does not work with VE."
