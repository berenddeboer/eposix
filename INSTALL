1. Make sure you have the EPOSIX environment variable set to the eposix
   root directory.

2. The only thing that needs to be built is the Eiffel/C glue library.
   It resides in the lib subdirectory.


** Unix **

On Unix type:

  ./configure --with-compiler=se|ise|ve --prefix=$EPOSIX
  make

to build it. On older systems try to use 'gmake' instead of 'make'.

Install the libraries in $EPOSIX/lib with:

  make install

If you have not specified the prefix, the libraries will go in
/usr/local/lib or /usr/lib.

If you develop multi-thread applications, perform the following steps:

  ./configure --with-compiler=se|ise|ve --prefix=$EPOSIX --enable-threads
  make clean
  make
  make install

You can have both single-thread and multi-thread libraries installed.


** Windows **

On Windows type:

  makelib

to get help about makelib. To build for ISE Eiffel and Microsoft Visual C,
type:

  makelib -ise -msc

If you are on a different platform than Linux or Windows you will have
to edit src/library.xace or eposix.ecf might to be able to link your
application properly. Read the comments in the file to see what must
be changed.

The defaults are correct for Linux and Windows (but not cygwin).
