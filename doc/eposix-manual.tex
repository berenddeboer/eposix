\title{Introduction}

It has been a great pleasure for me when I could announce the first
public alpha release of this manual. And then came the betas and the
first release. Writing libraries like this is boring stuff. Every
Eiffel programmer should have had access to all those Standard C and
\cap{posix} routines long ago. Anyway, now you and me have. Whatever a
C programmer can do, you can. And even more safe as this library
protects you of inadvertently calling routines that are not portable
(because they're simply not there :-) ).

Writing libraries like this also seems to be a never ending story, as
we now are at version 3.0. And my to do list hasn't shrinked, so stay
tuned!

I actively support this library, so bug reports and wishes are gladly
accepted. Planned extensions are 64 bit integer support in every
place, so you won't be limited to files of 2GB in size. And of course,
more and more support for the remaining functions in the Single Unix
Specification not yet covered, such as \posix{poll}. On the protocol
side I like to have NNTP server support. And perhaps one day we'll
have native SSL!

Have fun using this library and I like to hear about applications!


\subject{Licensing}

This software is licensed under the \index{MIT License}MIT
License. This \index{license}license can be found in the
\MYfilename{LICENSE} file. Basically this license allows you to do
anything with it, i.e. use it for commercial or \index{Open
  Source}Open Source software without restrictions. But don't sue me
if something goes wrong. And give me some credits.

Also explicitly allowed is copying parts of this library to your own,
for example copying certain Standard C or POSIX header wrappings. I
prefer linking, but you don't have to retype everything if you don't
want to link.


\subject{Support}

\eposix\ is a fully supported program. You can send requests for help
directly to me. But to help others profit from the discussion, and
perhaps to get feedback when I'm short on time, it is suggested that
support messages are sent to \from[eposixsupport].

Latest versions and announcements are available from
\from[eposixsupportpage].


\subject{Commercial support}

I'm available to give companies or organisations a one or two day
\index{support+commercial}course using \cap{posix} and in particularly
this library. Prices are \$1000 NZD a day, excluding VAT, travel and
hotel expenses. Contact me at \from[berend].


\subject{Acknowledgements}

I like to thank people who, one way or another, have helped me in
creating this library. They're listed in order they have been involved
with this library or manual:
\startitemize
\item \from[eugene]: compiled it with \index{Visual Eiffel}Visual
  Eiffel. As Visual Eiffel is the most strict compiler, he found a great
  many oversights that \index{SmallEiffel}SmallEiffel didn't catch.
\item \from[micoe]: I got many ideas for my C interface from the mico/E
  project. Sometime ago \from[andreass] wrote me that the micoe team
  wanted to use \eposix\ in mico/E. Andreas also reportexd problems and
  suggested improvements, especially in the \Eclass{EPX_CGI}
  class. Andreas and Robert Switzer, thanks for the bug reports!
\item \from[ida]: it was she who provided you with the \cap{posix} to
  Eiffel mapping table in \in{appendix}[sec:mapping].
\item \from[steve]: suggested improvements, found a CAT call problem
  and we had an interesting discussion about forking.
\item \from[jurgen] reported a problem with an
  example, and a bug in \Eclass{POSIX_EXEC_PROCESS}.
\item \from[marcio] contributed a lot to \eposix. He gave very useful
  advice, submitted code, and supplied patches to compile \eposix\
  better on Windows. I think it is fair to say that you thank the
  Windows support in \eposix\ to Marcio.
\item \from[eric]: I've had some insightful discussions with Eric
  regarding architecture of libraries such as \eposix. I think we
  never agreed :-), but the alternative error handling is due to his
  comments!\par
\item \from[andreasl]: Discussions about using \eposix\ which will lead
  to even closer integration with Gobo in subsequent releases.
\item \from[sven]: various comments and suggestions.
\item Colin Paul Adams: contributed classes such as the resolvers and
  fixes.
\item Till G. Bay: contributed multiplexing support for \eposix's
  socket class.
\stopitemize


\subject{Colophon}

The text of this manual was entered with GNU Emacs 21.4.2 on BLinux.
It was typeset with \pdfTeX\ using the \ConTeXt\ macro package, see
\from[context]. BON diagrams were created with \MetaPost.

\chapter{Requirements and installation}

\section{Requirements}

\eposix\ has three requirements:
\startitemize[n]
\item \eposix\ requires Gobo release 3.8 or higher. You can download
  Gobo at \from[gobo]. Gobo must be installed.
\item \eposix\ requires that the environment variable
  \index{environment variable+EPOSIX}\type{EPOSIX} is set to the root
  directory where the \eposix\ are unpacked.
\item On Windows, \eposix\ requires that the environment variable
  \index{environment variable+GOBO_CC}\type{GOBO_CC} is set to the name
  of the C compiler you are using. Failure to do so will result in
  link errors. Perhaps in a future \MYfilename{geant} release this
  will be set automatically.
\stopitemize


\section[sec:libeposix]{Compiling the C code}

Before \eposix\ can be used, a few C files need to be compiled into a
library. The steps differ if you are using a Unix derivative, or a
Windows based system.


\subsection{Compiling on Unix}

Before the C files can be compiled, \eposix\ must be configured. If
you have just one Eiffel compiler on your system, this should be
sufficient:

\starttyping
./configure --prefix=$EPOSIX
make
\stoptyping
%$

If you have multiple Eiffel compilers, you can specify the compiler
with:

\starttyping
./configure --with-compiler=ve --prefix=$EPOSIX
\stoptyping
%$

The \type{--prefix} switch is a trick to make sure that you can type:

\starttyping
make install
\stoptyping

after the make was successful. With this step the library is installed
into the \type{\$EPOSIX/lib} directory. This is the location where
\eposix's \MYfilename{src/library.xace} expects it. Without the
\type{--prefix} switch the library will usually be installed in
\filename{/usr/local/lib}.

If you develop \index{Unix+multi-threaded applications}multi-thread
applications, enable thread support with:

\starttyping
./configure --with-compiler=ise --prefix=$EPOSIX --enable-threads
make clean
make
make install
\stoptyping
%$

You can install both the multi-threaded library and the single thread
library at the same time.

In addition you have to make sure the \index{environment
variable+GOBO_MT}\type{GOBO_MT} environment variable is defined when
generating the \filename{.ecf} or \filename{.ace} file. This requires
a change to Gobo's \filename{eifel.eant} file.

In the target for xace add this line:

\starttyping
<define name="GOBO_MT" value="mt" if="${GOBO_MT}"/>
\stoptyping
%$

You can now pass the \type{GOBO_MT} variable like this:

\starttyping
geant -D "GOBO_MT=mt" compile_ise
\stoptyping

In case your applications are always multi-threaded, it might be
easier to copy \index{libmteposix_ise.a}\filename{libeposixmt_ise.a}
to \filename{libeposix_ise.a} so you don't have to bother with
this. The sole purpose of \type{GOBO_MT} is to pick
\filename{libeposixmt_ise.a} or \filename{libeposix_ise.a}.

More information about \MYfilename{configure} options can be displayed
with:

\starttyping
./configure --help
\stoptyping


\subsection{Compiling on Windows}

For Windows system, I've supplied a tool |<|build with \eposix|>| that
can build the necessary \eposix\ library for your Eiffel and C compiler.

Type:

\starttyping
makelib
\stoptyping

to get help. Type:

\starttyping
makelib -ise -msc
\stoptyping

to compile the C code with \index{C compiler+Microsoft}Microsoft's
Visual C compiler targeting the \index{ISE Eiffel}ISE Eiffel compiler.

Type:

\starttyping
makelib -se -bcb
\stoptyping

to compile the C code with \index{C compiler+Borland}Borland's C
compiler targeting \index{SmartEiffel}SmartEiffel. It was tested with
the free Borland C version 5.5 compiler.

Type:

\starttyping
makelib -se -lcc
\stoptyping

to compile the C code with \index{elj-win32}elj-win32's
\index{C compiler+lcc}lcc C compiler.

If you have both the Borland C compiler and lcc installed, make sure
the \MYfilename{make.exe} in your path is the correct one!

The generated library will have the name of the C compiler in its
path. Make sure \index{environment variable+GOBO_CC}\type{GOBO_CC} has
the correct value when compiling an \eposix\ program, see
\in{table}[table:gobocc].

\placetable
  []
  [table:gobocc]
  {Possible values for the \type{GOBO_CC} environment variable}
\starttable[|l|l|]
\HL
\NC \type{bcb} \NC Borland C compiler. \NC\SR
\NC \type{msc} \NC Microsoft C compiler. \NC\SR
\NC \type{lcc} \NC lcc-win32 compiler. \NC\SR
\HL
\stoptable

If you want to compile the \eposix\ library for use in a
\index{multi-threaded programming}multi-threaded application, pass the
\type{-mt} switch to \MYfilename{makelib.exe}:

\starttyping
makelib -ise -msc -mt
\stoptyping

You must pass the \type{-mt} flag for ISE Eiffel 5.6 if you are using
the Microsoft Visual C compiler. You also will have to copy the
\index{libmteposix_ise_msc.lib}multi-threaded library to the
\index{libeposix_ise_msc.lib}single-threaded library:

\starttyping
cd lib
copy libmteposix_ise_msc.lib libeposix_ise_msc.lib
\stoptyping

This is only supported for the ISE Eiffel compiler. \eposix\ is not
specifically written for use in multi-threaded programs nor tested
much in such environments. There are certain areas (exit handling,
signal handling) that are not multi-thread safe.


\subsection{Library naming conventions}

The name of this library starts with {\tt libeposix}. On Unix the name
of the Eiffel vendor is appended, so \MYfilename{libeposix_se.a} is
the library for SmartEiffel. On Windows systems the name of the Eiffel
vendor and the C compiler are appended. On Windows different C
compilers have incompatible libraries, so they need to be
distinguished. On Windows the \eposix\ library for ISE Eiffel compiled
with the Microsoft Visual C compiler is called
\MYfilename{libeposix_ise_msc.lib}.

The vendor names are derived from the names the Gobo Eiffel package
uses, i.e. the \index{environment variable+GOBO_EIFFEL}\type{GOBO_EIFFEL} environment variable.

The C compiler is derived from the \index{environment
variable+GOBO_CC}\type{GOBO_CC} environment variable.




\chapter{Using \eposix}

\section{Using {\tt library.xace}}

Since Gobo 3.0 Eiffel library writes have a new great tool at their
dispose: \MYfilename{gexace}. Eiffel library writers have to write and
maintain just a single file, \MYfilename{library.xace}. You can this
file file in the \eposix\ \type{src} subdirectory.

Typically, a \MYfilename{library.xace} is included in a
\MYfilename{system.xace}. A typical example, including all required
Gobo files, is:

\typeXMLfile{system.xace}


\section{Vendor specific notes}

\subsection{Gobo Eiffel}

\eposix\ supports the Gobo Eiffel compiler of Gobo version 3.8 or
higher. Multi-threading has not been tested with this compiler.

\subsection{ISE Eiffel}

\eposix\ supports \index{ISE Eiffel 5.6}ISE Eiffel 5.6 and higher.
\eposix\ has been tested under the following conditions:
\startitemize[n]
\item I used Microsoft Windows 2000, Service Pack 2.
\item I used the \index{C compiler+Borland}Borland C 5.5 and \index{C
  compiler+Microsoft Visual C++}Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler.
\stopitemize

Note that you need the multithreaded version of the C binding library
if you use ISE Eiffel 5.6 and the Microsoft Visual C compiler. Else
you will get a linker message complaining about the unresolved
external symbol \external{_errno}.

If you use \index{ISE Eiffel 6.2}ISE Eiffel 6.2, you can use the
supplied \MYfilename{eposix.ecf} which will make inclusion of eposix
in your projects much easier.


\subsection{SmartEiffel}

\eposix\ was tested with SmartEiffel 1.2r7 on FreeBSD, Linux, QNX,
Solaris and Windows.

Because SmartEiffel has a tendency to provide lots of non-ELKS
routines in its kernel classes |<|a bad thing in my opinion|>| I had to
write a new \Eclass{ANY}. My \Eclass{ANY} renames
\Efeature[GENERAL]{remove_file}, so I wouldn't get a conflict with
\Efeature[POSIX_FILE_SYSTEM]{remove_file}.

There is no reason for the presence of
\Efeature[GENERAL]{remove_file}, I expect this to be removed
soon\footnote{I wrote that two years ago\dots}, so my \Eclass{ANY} can
be deleted when this has happened.

If you use lcc-win32 as your C compiler, note that for the Gobo
\Eclass{XM_UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASSES} class SmartEiffel generates code
that does not compile with lcc-win32 due to some line length
limit. This problem was still present with the latest lcc-win32
compiler, version 3.8, compiled on December 23.

If you use SmartEiffel and if you don't use Gobo's gexace tool to
generate SmartEiffel's Ace file, you might see a complaint about a
routine \posix{stdc_signal_switch_switcher} not being found when
linking. In that case you will need to put a \MYfilename{cecil.se}
file in your directory. The contents of this file should be:

\starttyping
-- The name of our include C file:
cecil.h
-- The features called from C:
stdc_signal_switch_switcher STDC_SIGNAL_SWITCH switcher
stdc_exit_switch_at_exit STDC_EXIT_SWITCH at_exit
\stoptyping

But I strongly suggest to make the switch to Gobo's gexace tool as
this tool makes compilation for different Eiffel compilers a lot
easier.


\section{Platform specific notes}

Although \eposix\ should, in principle, run on every platform that
supports Standard C or \cap{posix}, it cannot be tested on every
platform by me alone. This section gives details about the platforms
I've used. The main thing you might need to do is to edit \eposix's
\MYfilename{src/library.xace} to the proper libraries for your
platform are linked. The default \MYfilename{src/library.xace} is
suited for Windows and Linux only. If you use any other platform, you
will have to edit \MYfilename{src/library.xace}.

\subsection{Linux}

The latest version of \eposix\ was tested on Ubuntu 8.0.4. and
\index{glibc}glibc 2.4.

\subsection{FreeBSD}

The latest version of \eposix\ was tested with FreeBSD 6.2-STABLE.
FreeBSD doesn't support \posix{fdatasync}, so we do a \posix{fsync}
there. Cases like that are automatically detected by the
\MYfilename{configure} script.

You have to edit \MYfilename{/src/library.xace} to link the proper
library for \index{FreeBSD}FreeBSD. Look at the comments.

After a \type{make clean} you have to use gmake instead of make.


\subsection{Cygwin}

The latest version of \eposix\ was tested with \index{cygwin}Cygwin
1.3.x. Some remarks:
\startitemize[n]
\item Locking doesn't seem to be supported.
\item fifo's (\posix{mkfifo}) are not supported.
\item No support for \posix{fdatasync}, so we do a \posix{fsync}
  there.
\stopitemize

\subsection{BeOS}

The latest version of \eposix\ was tested with \index{BeOS}BeOS
5.03. BeOS has a nice \cap{posix} compatibility layer. Some remarks:
\startitemize[n]
\item Locking doesn't seem to be supported.
\item fifo's (\posix{mkfifo}) are not supported.
\item Hard links are not supported, only symbolic links.
\item No support for \posix{fdatasync}, so we do a \posix{fsync}
  there.
\item Sockets work in BeOS, but they are not file descriptors. Stick
  to the \Eclass{EPX_SOCKET} classes like
  \Eclass{EPX_TCP_CLIENT_SOCKET}. Never pass a socket to an
  \Eclass{ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR} as that will not work.\par
  The trick is that \Efeature{read} and \Efeature{write} in
  \Eclass{EPX_SOCKET} call \posix{recv} and \posix{sendmsg}. If you
  pass a socket to an \Eclass{ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}, the POSIX
  \posix{read} and \posix{write} routines will be called.
\item \index{BeOS}BeOS does not support
  \index{BeOS+non-blocking i/o}non-blocking i/o on file descriptors or
  sockets. \eposix\ says it does if you ask
  \Efeature[ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR]{supports_nonblocking_io}, but it
  doesn't.\par
  BeOS has some options for non-blocking sockets, but they're very
  primitive and it seems you can't turn blocking off once it has been
  turned on for example.
\stopitemize


\subsection{QNX}

The latest version of \eposix\ was tested with \index{QNX}QNX 6.2.1.

You have to edit \MYfilename{/src/library.xace} to link the proper
library for QNX. Look at the comments.


\subsection{Solaris}

\eposix\ was tested against \index{Solaris}Solaris 10 for Intel. Make
sure to add the \type{-std=c99} option to \index{environment
  variable+CFLAGS}\type{CFLAGS}. Solaris seems to require this if the
POSIX-1.2001 define is set.

You have to edit \MYfilename{/src/library.xace} to link the proper
library for Solaris. Look at the comments.


\subsection{Win32}

The latest version of \eposix\ was tested with
\index{Windows 2000}Windows 2000, Service Pack 2.  On Win32,
Standard C is fully supported. With \eposix's abstract layer, parts
of \POSIX\ and the Single Unix Specification are also
supported. Support isn't as extensive as using the
\index{Cygwin}Cygwin tools.




\chapter{Design notes}

\section{Why an entire reimplementation?}

One might wonder why I reimplemented the entire Standard C and
\cap{posix} library when most vendors also have classes that deal with
files, the file system, signals and such. Unfortunately, these classes
are nor complete nor very portable between vendors. For someone who
wants to compile against all the major vendors |<|and there are good
reasons to do this|>| there is currently no portable solution. That's
why many portable Eiffel programs more or less contain the same code
again and again. There are some attempts to write more portable
libraries, for example the \from[ufdhc] by Friedrich Dominicus, but
they also are not complete nor is the implementation satisfactory. For
example they usually have much logic at the C level. I wanted only C
glue code: all intelligence should be in the Eiffel code.

Another attempt is done by the Gobo cluster: it attempts to provide
users with a set of classes that work accross all Eiffel vendors by
using only the native facilities offered by each implementation. This
approach has the advantage that no C compilation is necessary. The
disadvantages are:
\startitemize[n]
\item The contract for these classes is probably not specifiable: for
  which platforms and which assumptions are the contracts valid? Are
  these contracts the same in all implementations?
\item It is incomplete, i.e. it doesn't cover most of the
  \cap{posix} routines.
\stopitemize

That's why I started to make the entire Standard C and \cap{posix}
routines available to Eiffel programmers. All these routines are
nicely wrapped in classes. I spend a lot of time designing and
refactoring these, comments and improvements about its structure are
very appreciated.

The advantage of making \cap{posix} available to Eiffel programmers is
that someone doesn't need to think about creating a set of portable
file and directory classes that work on every known operating
system. \cap{posix} is available on many platforms and for other
systems there either is an emulation or a \cap{posix} mapping
available. It's better to reuse that, instead of reinventing work that
took years to complete.


\section{Goals and guidelines}
The goals and guidelines for this library were:
\startitemize[n]
\item A complete Standard C implementation for those who didn't have
  access to \cap{posix} routines.
\item A complete \cap{posix} implementation.
\item Do the job in such a way that it will become the official Eiffel
  \cap{POSIX} mapping.
\item All classes should satisfy the demands posed by the
  query||command separation principle.
\item The native Standard C and \cap{posix} routines should be
  available to those who don't want to go through a certain class
  layer.
\item The names in use in the \cap{posix} world like file descriptor
  or memory map are used as class names. This should make it easy to
  find a class if one knows the \cap{posix} name.
\item If a command fails, an exception code is raised. This differs
  from the \cap{posix} routines where one is expected to test for
  error and query the \posix{errno} variable. The only exception is
  \posix{unlink}: when the file does not exist, no exception is
  raised.
\item \cap{posix} assumptions should be made explicit. For Eiffel this
  means specifying explicit pre|| and postconditions.
\item Use of constants to influence the way a method should
  be avoided by providing clearly named methods. So instead of passing
  a constants to the \Efeature[POSIX_FILE]{open} function to open a file
  read||only, one can also call \Efeature{open_read}.
\item Attempt to create non-deferred class that refer to an entity that exists
  in the \cap{posix} world. Creation of an object is binding to that
  entity, or creation of that entity.
\item Names should be clear, and Eiffel||like. They should not differ
  in just one character. \cap{posix} names are also made available to
  ease use of this library for programmers that know \cap{posix} well.
\stopitemize


\section{Class structure}

\eposix\ makes available all the Standard C and \cap{posix} headers in
classes like \Eclass{CAPI_STDIO} and \Eclass{PAPI_UNISTD}. More
details about the header translation are in \in{chapter}[sec:cheader].

However, making the plain C API available is not a very interesting
addition to an Eiffel programmer's toolkit. Therefore, this library's
second attempt was to make an effective OO||wrapper, while making
a careful distinction between what is available in the Standard C and
what is available in \cap{posix}. This distinction is reflected in
\eposix's directory structure, see \in{figure}[fig:directory].

\placefigure
  []
  [fig:directory]
  {\eposix\ directory structure}
  {\externalfigure[directory]}

The raw Standard C API is available in \filename{src/capi}, the
OO||wrapper is available in \filename{src/standardc}. The raw
\cap{posix} API is available in \filename{src/papi}, the OO||wrapper
is available in \filename{src/posix}.

Every Standard C and \cap{posix} wrapper is derived from a common
root, see also \in{figure}[fig:inheritance]:
\startitemize[n]
\item If a class builds upon facilities available on Standard C, its
  name starts with the prefix STDC_ and it inherits from
  \Eclass{STDC_BASE}.
\item If a class builds upon facilities available in \POSIX, its
  name starts with the prefix POSIX_ and it inherits from
  \Eclass{POSIX_BASE}.
\item If a class builds upon facilities available in the Single Unix
  Specification, its name starts with the prefix SUS_ and it inherits from
  \Eclass{SUS_BASE}. The support for the Single Unix Specification is
  not yet complete, but is continually enhanced.
\item Because we live in a world dominated by Microsoft Windows, and
  Microsoft Windows does not do \POSIX, this would mean that many
  users only could use \eposix's Standard C facilities. These
  facilities are extremely limiting, for example there is no change
  directory command in Standard C. Therefore \eposix\ makes available
  an abstraction layer that covers routines that have an equivalent in
  \POSIX\ and the Single Unix Specification. These classes start with
  the name EPX_. They always inherit from classes starting with
  ABSTRACT_. These abstract classes implement the common code. See
  \in{chapter}[sec:nativewindows] for more details.\par
  Note that by using \index{cygwin}Cygwin you have a full
  \POSIX\ emulation layer on Windows. In that specific environment you
  can use \eposix's entire \POSIX\ and Single Unix Specification layer.
\stopitemize

\placefigure
  []
  [fig:inheritance]
  {Inheritance structure}

  {\externalfigure[abcdef]}
  {}
  {\externalfigure[inherit.1]}
  {}
  {\externalfigure[inherit.2]}
  {}
  {\externalfigure[inherit.4]}
  {}
\stopcombination}

The wrapper classes should be fully command||query separated and use
clear names. Often the \cap{posix} name, if applicable, is also made
available as an alias. If this is a good thing, I'm not sure. I hope
it facilitates working with the wrapper classes if you already know
\cap{posix}.

Besides these directories, \eposix\ provides a number of extensions to
the pure Standard C or \cap{posix} routines. These can be found in the
subdirectories that start with \filename{src/epx}. A single letter
indicates if the classes only built upon routines available in
Standard C or \cap{posix}:
\startitemize[n]
\item \MYfilename{epxc}: Standard C based extensions like
  \index{URI}URI resolving, a \index{MIME}MIME parser and \cap{XML}
  generation.
\item \MYfilename{epxs}: Single Unix Specification based extension
  like an \index{HTTP} HTTP client.
\stopitemize


\section{Clients of this library}

For client classes, two important classes are \Eclass{STDC_CONSTANTS}
and \Eclass{POSIX_CONSTANTS}, see \in{figure}[bon:constants]. The
wrapper classes tend to avoid having routines whose behavior
drastically depends on passed constants. But if you need to use
constants, your client class can just inherit from these classes and
every Standard C and \cap{posix} constant is available.

\placefigure

\section{Forking}

Implementing forking posed some interesting challenges. I started with
the basic idea that every process has a pid:

\startEIFFEL
class PROCESS

feature

   pid: INTEGER

end
\stopEIFFEL

I wanted to be able to write two kinds of forking. The first one is
forking a child as in:

\startEIFFEL
class PARENT

inherit

   POSIX_CURRENT_PROCESS

feature

   make is
      local
         child: POSIX_CHILD_PROCESS
      do
         print ("My pid: ")
         print (pid)
         print ("%N")
         fork (child)
         print ("child's pid: ")
         print (child.pid)
         print ("%N")
         child.wait_for (True)
      end

end
\stopEIFFEL

However, I also wanted to fork myself, because that basically is what
forking is!

\startEIFFEL
class PARENT

inherit

   POSIX_CURRENT_PROCESS

   POSIX_CHILD_PROCESS

feature

   make is
      do
         fork (Current)
         wait
      end

   execute is
      do
         -- forked code
      end

end
\stopEIFFEL

The above code gives a name clash, because
\Efeature[POSIX_CURRENT_PROCESS]{pid} is a call to the \cap{posix}
routine \posix{getpid}, while the child's pid is a variable, which
gets a variable after forking. You can solve this name clash yourself,
but it is most easy to inherit from \Eclass{POSIX_FORK_ROOT}, a clash
which has solved this clash already.

If you fork a child, you must wait for it. For a child process, you
can use \Efeature[POSIX_CHILD]{wait_for}, if you fork yourself, you
must use \Efeature[POSIX_CURRENT_PROCESS]{wait}. The variable
\Efeature{waited_child_pid} will be set with the pid of the child
process that \Efeature{wait} waited for.


\section{Books}

Books that have been helpful during the development of \eposix\ where
\cite[POSIX1003.1], \cite[Plauger1991] and \cite[Lewine1994], see the
biography section at \at{page}[sec:biography].




\chapter{Layers}

\section{Layers architecture}

\eposix\ is written in such a way that it is possible to write a pure
Standard C based application (ANSI/ISO IS 9899: 1990), a pure
\cap{posix} application (Standard ISO/IEC-9945-1: 1990), or a pure
Single Unix Specification version 3 application (\from[sus]). Although
\cap{posix} and the Single Unix Specification merged there
specifications, they are still kept separate in \eposix, because the
merge happened relatively recently and the pure \cap{posix} functions
are more very widely supported.

Based on these standards \eposix\ offers a compatibility layer. This
layer offers a common framework for people that want to write code
that works on both Unix and Windows systems. The compatibility layer
uses all features that an operating system offers. If you use the
network compatibility layer for example, you need a system that
supports the Single Unix Specification.


\section{Standard C}

All Standard C classes start with \cap{stdc_}. They are:
\startitemize[n]
\item \Eclass{STDC_TEXT_FILE}: access text files.
\item \Eclass{STDC_BINARY_FILE}: access binary files.
\item \Eclass{STC_TEMPORARY_FILE}: create a \index{temporary
  file}temporary file, a file that is removed when it is closed or
  when the program terminates.
\item \Eclass{STDC_CONSTANTS}: access Standard C constants like error
  codes and such.
\item \Eclass{STDC_BUFFER}: allocate dynamic memory.
\item \Eclass{STDC_ENV_VAR}: access environment variables.
\item \Eclass{STDC_FILE_SYSTEM}: delete and rename files.
\item \Eclass{STDC_SHELL_COMMAND}: pass an arbitrary command to the
  native shell.
\item \Eclass{STDC_SYSTEM}: access information about the system the
  program is running on.
\item \Eclass{STDC_CURRENT_PROCESS}: access to current process related
  information like its standard input, output and error streams.
\item \Eclass{STDC_TIME}: access current time. Also can format a given
  time in various formats.
\stopitemize


\section[sec:windows]{Windows}

\subsection{Writing portable programs}

\eposix\ offers three alternatives to writing programs that run on
both Unix and Windows platforms:
\startitemize[n]
\item Write programs that only rely on Standard C. If you use only
  Standard C classes your program is probably quite portable. Standard C
  doesn't offer that much however.
\item Write programs that are based on \POSIX. You use a \cap{posix}
  emulator to compile and run your program unchanged on Windows. The
  only thing you have to be aware of is the distinction between binary
  and text files.
\item Write programs that are based upon \eposix's EPX_XXXX
  layer. This layer is based on \eposix's ABSTRACT_XXXX classes, that
  covers code that is common between Windows and a
  \POSIX\ platform.\par
  Previous versions of \eposix\ used a factory class approach to
  access this common code. This is no longer needed. The ABSTRACT_XXXX
  are maded effective through EPX_XXXX classes when compiling for
  Windows or for \POSIX.
\stopitemize

The following sections offer more details about the last two approaches.


\subsection{Compiling POSIX programs in Windows}

You can also use a very large subset of \cap{posix} under Windows with
a \cap{posix} emulator. I've tested this using SmartEiffel and Cygwin's freely
available emulator. Here the steps:
\startitemize[n]
\item Download the Cygwin toolkit from \from[cygwindownload].
\item Set the compiler in \MYfilename{compiler.se} to
  \type{gcc}. Leave the system in \MYfilename{system.se} to Windows.
\item Configure \eposix\ as described in \in[sec:libeposix] and create
  \MYfilename{libeposix_se.a}
\stopitemize

A few things are not available under Cygnus' \cap{posix} emulation:
\startitemize[n]
\item \Efeature[POSIX_FILE_SYSTEM]{create_fifo} is not supported. Any
  attempt to use it will return \cdefine{ENOSYS}. I'm not sure if
  returning an error is the correct solution for applications that
  require \cap{posix} compatibility, because you are only warned at
  run||time. Another solution would be to include a call to
  \posix{mkfifo} and if you use it, let the linker complain.
  \item There is no locking, so calls to
  \Efeature[POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR]{get_lock} and such will fail.
\item Certain \cap{posix} tests assume that a more Unix like
  environment is available, so not all tests will run. For example the
  standard Cygwin distribution doesn't have a \filename{more}
  utility. If you make a symbolic link from \filename{less} to
  \filename{more} the child process test will run.
\item The current list of implemented functions is available from
  \from[cygwinfuncs].
\stopitemize


\subsection[sec:nativewindows]{Native Windows}

Previous versions of \eposix\ used a factory class approach to access
Windows or \POSIX\ specific code. This is obsolete.

If you want to write code that is portable between Windows and \POSIX\
use the EPX_XXXX class layer. For example you can use the
\Eclass{EPX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR} to use file descriptors that are
completely portable between these two OSes. Use
\Eclass{EPX_FILE_SYSTEM} to have access to file system specific code
to change directories or get the temporary directory.

In general you can replace the POSIX_ prefix with EPX_ to compile most
of the examples presented in the previous \POSIX\ specific
chapters. The classes currently available in the EPX_XXXX layer are:

\startitemize
\item \Eclass{EPX_CURRENT_PROCESS}.
\item \Eclass{EPX_EXEC_PROCESS}.
\item \Eclass{EPX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}.
\item \Eclass{EPX_FILE_SYSTEM}.
\item \Eclass{EPX_PIPE}.
\stopitemize

Figure one shows hoe the \Eclass{EPX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR} class is derived
from \Eclass{ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}. Both Windows and \POSIX\ have
an effective \Eclass{EPX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR} class. Classes as
\Eclass{POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR} implement \POSIX\ specific
functionality for a file descriptor.

\placefigure
  []
  [bon:epxclass]
  {How EPX_XXXX classes are related to the \POSIX\ and Windows classes}
  {\externalfigure[epxclass]}

An example of using the \Eclass{EPX_FILE_SYSTEM} class is shown below:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_epx1.e}

In \in{appendix}[classess::appendix:abstract] all abstract classes are
listed. There deferred features are made effective in the \cap{EPX}
class for the operating system you're compiling for.

% With \eposix's factory classes you can write programs that have
% features between Standard C and POSIX. Windows offers many services
% that are more or less equal to POSIX programs. Windows specific
% classes inherit from \Eclass{WINDOWS_BASE}, see
% \in{figure}[bon:windowsinheritance].

% \placefigure
%   []
%   [bon:windowsinheritance]
%   {Windows inheritance structure}
%   {\winbase}

% \eposix\ has abstracted features available in both Windows and
% \cap{posix} in its `ABSTRACT_XXXX' classes. In your program you don't
% use the Windows classes directly, but you use a factory. If you
% compile against a \cap{posix} platform, a \cap{posix} specific class
% is returned. If you compile against a Windows platform, a Windows
% specific class is returned. In \in{figure}[bon:factory] a BON diagram
% of the classes involved in this process are shown.

% \placefigure
%   []
%   [bon:factory]
%   {Using abstract classes through a factory}
%   {\factory}

% The class \Eclass{EPX_FACTORY} is either Windows or \cap{posix}
% specific. There is such a class in the \filename{src/windows}
% directory and one in the \filename{src/posix} directory. By including
% one of these directories in your \MYfilename{loadpath.se}, it can be
% found. Make sure to include only one of these directories.

% First an example to make it more clear:

% \typeEIFFELfile{ex_factory1.e}

% If you want to access the factory, it is easiest to inherit from
% \Eclass{EPX_FACTORY}. To access the file system, this class offers the
% \Efeature{fs} feature. \Efeature{fs} is an
% \Eclass{ABSTRACT_FILE_SYSTEM}. In your program you use only features
% available in \Eclass{ABSTRACT_FILE_SYSTEM}. At run||time you either
% get a \Eclass{WINDOWS_FILE_SYSTEM} or a \Eclass{POSIX_FILE_SYSTEM}.

% You can also access file descriptors through
% \Eclass{ABSTRACT_FILE_SYSTEM}. This class has features as
% \Efeature{create_read_write} and \Efeature{open_read_write} which
% return an instantiated file descriptor class.


\section{Introduction to the next chapters}

The following chapters are topic based: they discuss how to work with
files for example and show examples for all layers and give hints what
is and what isn't supported in each layer.

Instead of describing every class and every feature, I decided to show
short and simple examples of common ways to use the various \eposix\
classes. Most examples assume a \cap{posix} or Single Unix
Specification environment. If you don't have \cap{posix} available,
you can try to replace the \type{POSIX_} prefix by \type{STDC_}. Most
of the time the \cap{posix} classes are based on the Standard C
classes.

If you are looking for more examples, you might take a look at the
classes in the \filename{test_suite}
\index{directory+test_suite}directory. These classes should
demonstrate and test almost every feature available in the \cap{posix}
classes.




\chapter{Working with memory}

\section{Introduction}

\eposix\ has several classes that allocate memory. The main class is
\Eclass{STDC_BUFFER} (or the equivalent \Eclass{POSIX_BUFFER}). This
class allocates a memory block that isn't moved by the garbage
collector. This is very useful for an Eiffel compiler that has a
moving garbage collector.

You can also get access to shared memory using
\Eclass{POSIX_SHARED_MEMORY}.


\section[standardc:dynamic_memory]{Allocating memory}

You can dynamically allocate memory with \Eclass{STDC_BUFFER}
which works just like \Eclass{POSIX_BUFFER}.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_mem2.e}

With the feature \Efeature[STDC_BUFFER]{allocate_and_clear}
memory is allocated and cleared to all zeros.

\Eclass{STDC_BUFFER} contains many routines to read bytes and
strings from the memory it manages like \Efeature{peek_int16},
\Efeature{peek_uint16}, or \Efeature{peek_int32}. It supports reading
and writing 16 and 32 bit integers in \index{little endian}little and
\index{big endian}big endian order with routines as
\Efeature{peek_int16_big_endian}, \Efeature{peek_int16_little_endian},
and \Efeature{poke_int32_big_endian}.


\section{Allocating memory}

Allocating dynamic memory is very useful, but not portably available
for Eiffel programmers. With \Eclass{POSIX_BUFFER} memory can
be allocated, read and written to.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_mem.e}

For more information about the dynamic memory class, see
\in{section}[standardc:dynamic_memory].


\section{Using shared memory}

You can use shared memory to exchange data between different
processes. It's dependent on your \POSIX\ version if this is
supported, so check for this capability explicitly!

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_shared_mem1.e}

Make sure you always start a shared memory object with a slash. Else
the behaviour is undefined or processes might not be able to find your
shared memory.

There is not yet an abstract layer implementing shared memory, but you
can use \Eclass{WINDOWS_PAGING_FILE_SHARED_MEMORY} on Windows to get a
similar effect.


\section{Memory maps}

You can map a file to memory using \Eclass{POSIX_MEMORY_MAP}.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_memory_map1.e}

There is no equivalent abstract layer class for memory mapping to
support Windows yet.




\chapter{Working with files}


\section{Introduction}

\eposix\ offers two different file classes: Standard C stream based
and \cap{posix} file descriptor classes. The main difference between
stream and descriptor based classes is that the stream classes offer
read and write caching. Output is not immediately written to disk or
network for example.


\section{Standard C notes}

If you don't have access to a \cap{posix} compatible system, you can
use the underlying Standard C classes. Standard C is quite restricted
in certain respects: you cannot change directories for example. On the
other hand, this library gives you access to all Standard C routines,
so you can use what's there and write an extremely portable program.


\section[sec:gobo]{Compatibility with Gobo}

Since version 2.0 \eposix\ is built upon foundations laid in
\index{Gobo}Gobo. \eposix\'s \Eclass{STDC_FILE}/\Eclass{POSIX_FILE}
and \Eclass{ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR} are implementations of
\Eclass{KI_CHARACTER_INPUT_STREAM} and
\Eclass{KI_CHARACTER_OUTPUT_STREAM}.

The \eposix\ class \Eclass{ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR} has support for
\index{non-blocking i/o}non-blocking i/o, see
\in{section}[sec:nonblockingio]. Gobo's
\Eclass{KI_CHARACTER_INPUT_STREAM} expects blocking i/o however. If
you call \Efeature[ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR]{read_string} you will
call the routine that has support for non-blocking i/o. Due to
Eiffel's renaming mechanism, \Eclass{ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR} will
behave blocking when it is called as if it was a
\Eclass{KI_CHARACTER_INPUT_STREAM}.

% YY_FILE_BUFFER implementations


\section{Working with streams}

The basic class for working with files, or streams as they are also
called, is \Eclass{POSIX_FILE}. There are two kinds of files:
\Eclass{POSIX_TEXT_FILE} and \Eclass{POSIX_BINARY_FILE}. According to
the \POSIX\ standard, there is no distinction between binary and text
files. But on certain systems you must use \POSIX\ programs through an
emulation layer. For example, on Windows Cygwin is a well||known
\POSIX\ emulator. To maintain compatibility with other Windows
programs, Cygwin distinguishes between text and binary files. If you
use Cygwin to compile your \POSIX\ programs, this distinction is
therefore still important.

The first example shows how to open a text file, see also the
corresponding BON diagram in \in{figure}[bon:exfileone].

\placefigure
  []
  [bon:exfileone]
  {BON diagram of opening a text file.}
  {\externalfigure[exfileone]}

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_file1.e}

It simply opens a file for reading and prints \index{file+read
entire}every line in it. Note that the line read does {\em not}
include the end-of-line character. This is a change in behaviour from
pre 2.0 \eposix\ versions.

\Eclass[POSIX_FILE] has two functions that read strings. These are
\Efeature{read_line} and \Efeature{read_string}. \Efeature{read_line}
only returns when it has read an end-of-line character. It it has to
read a 2GB characters to reach that, it will return a 2GB
string. \Efeature{read_string} returns a string with the given number
of characters, or less if the end of the file is reached. These two
functions have one other difference as well: \Efeature{read_line}
removes the end-of-line character(s), while \Efeature{read_string}
returns the raw string, including end-of-line characters and such.

At the end of the example, the file is closed. You don't need to
explicitly close a file as it will be closed when your object is
garbaged collected. But I think it's a good thing not to rely or
depend on this, but to close your external resources as soon as you're
done using them. For example many systems have easily reached limits
on the number of files a process can have open.

Reading binary files is almost the same \index{file+read entire}loop,
only you read it in chunks:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_file2.e}

This example uses a more safe version of buffer reading,
\Efeature[POSIX_FILE]{read_buffer}. There is an untyped variant
\Efeature[POSIX_FILE]{read} which accepts a pure pointer. There is no
need to mention that you need to watch buffer overflows carefully with
this last one!

Correctly looping through files, takes care. For example the following
loop is wrong:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_wrong1.e}

After \Efeature[POSIX_TEXT_FILE]{read_string}, \Efeature{end_of_input} might be
True. But the precondition for \Efeature{last_string} is that
\Efeature{end_of_input} is false. You will make an unnecessary extra loop. The
correctly coded variant is:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_wrong2.e}

I myself prefer the first example, as the check is only in the
\Ekeyword{until} part, and not repeated in the loop.

The following examples shows how a \index{binary file}binary file is
created and a string is written to it.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_file3.e}

Depending on the platform you are running a \index{backslash}backslash
is turned into a \index{slash}slash or vice versa.

This example also demonstrates how \index{path name}path names |<|file
and directory names|>| can be expanded: if you call
\Efeature[POSIX_FILE_SYSTEM]{expand_path}, any
\index{environment variable}environment variables in the path are
expanded. Backslashes and slashes are always translated, but
\index{Environment variable+expansion}environment variable expansion
has to be done explicitly.

You can \index{seek}move the \index{file pointer}file pointer with two
different methods: \Efeature[POSIX_FILE]{seek} and
\Efeature{set_position}. The \Efeature{seek} works with files up to 2
GB, \Efeature{set_position} has no such limits. Use \Efeature{tell} to
get a position that can be passed to \Efeature{seek}. Use
\Efeature{get_position} to get a position that can be passed to
\Efeature{set_position}.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_file5.e}


\section{Working with streams using Standard C only}

Working with text files is equal to the \cap{posix} classes, only you
use the \cap{stdc} prefix.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_file4.e}

Its BON diagram, see \in{figure}[bon:exfilethree] is therefore quite equal
to the \cap{posix} one, see \in{figure}[bon:exfileone].

\placefigure
  []
  [bon:exfilethree]
  {BON diagram of opening a Standard C text file.}
  {\externalfigure[exfilethree]}


\section{Working with file descriptors}

The file descriptors classes are quite equal to the file classes. The
following example opens a file using \Eclass{POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}
and reads the first 64 bytes.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_fd1.e}

Unlike \Eclass{POSIX_TEXT_FILE}, there is no easy way to detect end of
line and end of file conditions. However, a file descriptor can easily
be turned into a file as the following example demonstrates.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_fd2.e}

A file descriptor can also be used to \index{lock}lock, unlock or test
for locks on a given file as the following example demonstrates. See
also the accompanying BON diagram in \in{figure}[bon:exfdfour].

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_fd4.e}

\Efeature[POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR]{get_lock} is command||query
separated, that is why it returns a new lock when queried and there is
a lock. If there is no lock \Efeature{get_lock} returns Void. The
passed lock is not modified.

\placefigure

  [bon:exfdfour]
  {BON diagram of locking a portion of a file.}
  {\externalfigure[exfdfour]}

A file descriptor also gives you access to the attached
\index{terminal}terminal, if any. The following example demonstrates
how to read a \index{terminal+password}password without the password appearing
on the screen.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_fd3.e}


\section{Windows systems: binary mode versus text mode}

If you are using Unix exclusively, you can skip this section.

Independent of what layer you use to write Windows programs, you have
to deal with \index{binary mode}binary and \index{text mode}text
modes. And if you usually write Unix programs and want them to work on
Windows too, you have to bother with it too.

On Windows, each line of a text files ends with a carriage return
character followed by a line feed character. If you use a C text
stream to read a file on Windows, a trick is employed: every
occurrence of \type{"%R%N"} is replaced by a single \type{"%N"}. If
%R%you are actually a binary file, you might get unexpected results!
The same happens when writing to a text stream: you just have to write
a single \type{"%N"} and the C run-time code replaces this by
%\type{"%R%N"}.

So make sure you are using the proper classes if you use streams. Use
\Eclass{STDC_TEXT_FILE} if you want to read and write text files and
use \Eclass{STDC_BINARY_FILE} to read and write binary files.

File descriptors are binary only. So any descendant from
\Eclass{ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR} treats input and output as binary
and does no translation whatsoever. If you use
\Efeature[ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR]{read_line} to read lines, the
end-of-line character may either be a \type{"%R%N"} or just a
%R%\type{"%N"}. \Efeature{read_line} strips either of these
end-of-line characters regardless of the platform. So reading a file
with Windows end-of-line characters on Windows or Unix will work
exactly the same.

There is no explicit support for creating text files using file
descriptors with the proper Windows end of file characters. Use either
\Eclass{STDC_TEXT_FILE} to create platform dependent end-of-lines or
write the proper end-of-line characters yourself.

This discussion also applies to standard input and output. If you want
to use \index{binary stdin}binary \index{stdin+binary}standard input
or \index{binary stdout}binary \index{stdout+binary}standard output,
use the file descriptors available in \Eclass{EPX_CURRENT_PROCESS} as
\Efeature{fd_stdin} and \Efeature{fd_stdout}. If you use
\Efeature{stdin} and \Efeature{stdout} you can handle text files only
on Windows. On Unix it does not matter.

For Cygwin users the story is somewhat more difficult it seems. File
descriptors can be text or binary. The default is binary however. The
following information can be helpful to get the binary versus text
file distinction correct:
\startitemize
\item Mount the volume in binary mode.
\item Set the \index{environment variable+CYGWIN}environment variable
  \index{CYGWIN}CYGWIN to `binary'.
\stopitemize

More information about Cygwin and CR/LF handling can be found at
\from[cygwincrlf].



\chapter{Working with files: advanced topics}


\section{Redirecting stderr to stdout}

If you want to \index{redirect standard error}redirect all output
written by your program or any child you spawn to
\index{stdout}stdout, you can use the
\Efeature[POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR]{make_as_duplicate} call:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_redirect1.e}

It's a good idea to call this at the beginning of your program, before
you have written anything to \index{stderr}stderr or stdout. If you do
that, you don't have to \index{flush}flush the
\index{stream buffer}stream buffers.


\section{Talking to your modem}

With \eposix\ you can talk to your \index{modem}modem. The
implementation contains not all the details to write a full||featured
program as \index{minicom}minicom, but they will be added upon
request.

The following example tries to talk to your modem |<|which is expected
to be at \filename{/dev/modem}|>| and queries its manufacturer.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_modem.e}

\placefigure
  []
  [bon:exmodem]
  {BON diagram of talking to a modem.}
  {\externalfigure[exmodem]}


\section[sec:nonblockingio]{Non-blocking I/O}

\eposix\ supports \index{non-blocking i/o}non-blocking i/o on its file
descriptor classes, i.e. the descendants of
\Eclass{ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}. Use \Efeature{is_blocking_io} to
query if the descriptor blocks on \Efeature{read} or \Efeature{write}
if there is no data. Use \Efeature{set_blocking_io} to change the
behavior.

Use \Efeature{supports_nonblocking_io} to query if the behavior with
respect to blocking i/o can be changed. On Windows file i/o must be
blocking. Only sockets on Windows can be non-blocking. On Unix all
descriptors support non-blocking i/o.

See \index{Gobo}also \in{section}[sec:gobo] for non-blocking i/o when
\eposix\ is used as a plugin for classes that expect a
\Eclass{KI_CHARACTER_INPUT_STREAM}. In such cases \eposix\ reverts to
blocking i/o, even when non-blocking i/o has been enabled.


\section[sec:asynchronousio]{Asynchronous I/O}

\eposix\ supports the asynchronous i/o features of \cap{posix}. Not
all Free Unices seem to support this feature, nor does their support
seems to be error free.

Take a look at the following example:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_async1.e}

The basic idea is that each asynchronous request is a separate object,
modeled by \Eclass{POSIX_ASYNC_IO_REQUEST}. You prepare it
through calls like \Efeature{set_buffer}, \Efeature{set_count} and
\Efeature{set_offset}. You execute the request by calling
\Efeature{read} or \Efeature{write}.

You can wait for the request to be complete by calling
\Efeature{wait_for}. It should be possible to force open requests to
be synchronized to the disk with \Efeature{synchronize}, but this does
give strange results on Linux. So far I haven't got access to a
machine that also implements asynchronous i/o to test if my code is
correct.




\chapter{Working with the file system}

\section{Portability}

Use the \type{EPX_} classes to write code that is portable between
\cap{posix} systems and Windows.


\section{Standard C}

Standard C doesn't offer much for file systems. You can only delete
and rename files.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_dir5.e}

The BON diagram is shown in \in{figure}[bon:exdirfive].

\placefigure
  []
  [bon:exdirfive]
  {BON diagram of deleting and renaming files with Standard C.}
  {\externalfigure[exdirfive]}

But you can \index{filename manipulation}manipulate filenames
including directories, although technically they're not part of
Standard C. The following example shows how filenames can be
manipulated with \Eclass{STDC_PATH}:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_filename1.e}

The \Efeature{parse} feature is used to parse a path into its
components. Give it a suffix list to remove any matching suffices.
Suffix matching is case-insensitive. If the suffix list is empty, no
suffix matching will be done. This follows standard unix behaviour: if
a filename has a dot in it, it does not necessarily mean that what
follows after that dot is a suffix.

Create a path with \Efeature{make_expand} to expand any environment
variables in the given string to their values.


\section{POSIX}

\cap{posix} defines many commands to navigate a file system. They're
made available by the \Eclass{POSIX_FILE_SYSTEM}. The following
example \index{directory+change}navigates to the user's home
directory, \index{directory+create}create a directory and
\index{directory+remove}removes it.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_dir1.e}

To get access to the file system, inheriting from the
\Eclass{POSIX_FILE_SYSTEM} class is easiest.

There are also lots of functions to test for existence, readability or
writability of files. Use \Efeature{is_modifiable} to test if a file
is readable and writable.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_dir2.e}

Be aware that \Efeature[POSIX_FILE_SYSTEM]{is_readable} uses the real
user and group IDs instead of the effective ones.

As can be seen in the above example, one can test for the permissions
of a file using the \Eclass{POSIX_PERMISSIONS} class. A new
permissions class is created for every
\Efeature[POSIX_FILE_SYSTEM]{permissions} call, so it is best to cache
this object. If the permissions change on the file system, this class
does not reflect reality anymore, because it caches the
permissions. Use \Efeature[POSIX_PERMISSIONS]{refresh} to update the
contents. Use \Efeature{set_allow_group_write},
\Efeature{set_allow_anyone_read} and such to set permissions.

\eposix\ also gives you access to the \posix{stat} function using the
\Eclass{POSIX_STATUS} class.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_dir4.e}

The \Eclass{POSIX_STAT}, and through it \Eclass{POSIX_PERMISSIONS},
are also returned by \Efeature[POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR]{status}.


\index{directory+browse}Browsing a directory can be done by
allocated a \Eclass{POSIX_DIRECTORY} class through the
\Efeature[POSIX_FILE_SYSTEM]{browse_directory} feature:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_dir3.e}

As can be seen, \Eclass{POSIX_DIRECTORY} follows EiffelBase
conventions.

When browsing a directory, all entries in that directory are
returned. You might want to be interested only in certain
files. \eposix\ has the ability to define arbitrary filters. Standard
\eposix\ comes with an extension filter that only shows files with a
certain extension:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_dir6.e}




\chapter{Working with processes}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter discusses starting processes, either by executing new
ones or forking the current one. It also describes support for process
communication using signals.


\section{Executing a child command}

Any command line can be executed by using the
\Eclass{POSIX_SHELL_COMMAND} class. Just pass a command line and
\Efeature{execute} it.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_cmd.e}


\section{Reading stdout of a child process}

It is possible to read the standard output of a child process or write
to its standard input. This is one of the easiest ways to communicate
with child processes. The \Eclass{EPX_EXEC_PROCESS} class makes this
possible both under Windows and Unix. For example the creation feature
\Efeature{make_capture_output} makes the standard output of the child
available, while \Efeature{make_capture_input} makes the standard
input available.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_exec1.e}

The three features that give access to the child's standard input,
standard output and standard error pipes are named
\Efeature{fd_stdin}, \Efeature{fd_stdout} and \Efeature{fd_stderr}.

It is important to wait for the child that has been executed at some
point in time, just like any \POSIX\ aplication would have to do. If
you do not wait for a child process, memory in the kernel is not
released and eventually you would run out of processes. Also only
after the \Efeature[EPX_EXEC_PROCESS]{wait_for} command is the exit
code of the process available.

It is possible to write to standard input and read standard output and
standard error at the same time, but this requires extreme care. It
usually leads to code that deadlocks, because the parent process is
reading the standard output of the child and the child is waiting for
the parent to write to its standard input. Or the child is blocked
while writing to its standard output, because its output buffer is
full. But the parent process isn't reading the child's standard
output, because it is trying to write to the child's standard input.

Under \POSIX\ it is possible to use the buffered features
\Efeature{stdin}, \Efeature{stdout} and \Efeature{stderr}. The
following example is the same as the previous example, but uses the
\Eclass{POSIX_EXEC_PROCESS} class:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_exec2.e}

It is possible to check if a child process has terminated or not. Pass
False to the suspend parameter of the
\Efeature[EPX_EXEC_PROCESS]{wait_for} feature and check
\Efeature{is_terminated} to see if the child process has stopped or
not.


\section{Catching a signal with Standard C}

You can catch signals with Standard C. The following example
demonstrates a program that can be safely interrupted by pressing
\index{Ctrl+C}Ctrl+C:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_signal3.e}

As Standard C doesn't have a sleep command, this program uses
\Eclass{EPX_CURRENT_PROCESS} to get either the \Efeature{sleep} from
\POSIX\ or from Windows.

More explanation about the program itself can be found in
\in{section}[sec:catchsignal].


\section[sec:catchsignal]{Catching a signal with \cap{posix}}

Every class can become a \index{signal handler}signal handler by
inheriting from \Eclass{POSIX_SIGNAL_HANDLER}. Implement the
\Efeature{signalled} method as that is the function that is called
when the signal occurs. Use \Efeature[POSIX_SIGNAL]{set_handler} to
make your class a signal handler and call \Efeature{apply} to start
receiving signals when they occur.

The following examples demonstrates a program that can be safely
interrupted by pressing \index{Ctrl+C}Ctrl+C:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_signal1.e}

All precautions and warnings when handling signals in C apply equally
well in Eiffel of course. While in a signal handler, the signal will
not be delivered again. Call
\Efeature[STDC_SIGNAL_HANDLER]{reestablish} to make your signal
handler interruptable.

You can write a single signal handler, that handles multiple
signals. This makes it possible to have signal handling code in just
one place. Create a class that inherits from
\Eclass{POSIX_SIGNAL_HANDLER}. Pass this class to the
\Efeature[POSIX_SIGNAL]{set_handler} for every signal you want to
catch. The signal value is passed as parameter to
\Efeature[POSIX_SIGNAL_HANDLER]{signalled}, so you can write an
\Ekeyword{inspect} statement based on the value.


\section{General wait for child handler}

If you do not want to wait for every child process explicitly, you can
write a simple \index{SIGCHLD}SIGCHLD handler that just does a
wait (I found this idea in \cite[unixnetwork1]):

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_signal2.e}

In Unix 98 you should be able to set the ignore handler for this
signal. In pure \POSIX\ systems the behaviour of the ignore handler is
unspecified.


\section{Forking a child process}

Forking is very easy with this Eiffel \cap{posix} implementation. The
steps:
\startitemize[n]
\item Write a child by inheriting from \Eclass{POSIX_FORK_ROOT} and
  implementing its \Efeature{execute} method.
\item The class that will do the forking, should inherit from
  \Eclass{POSIX_CURRENT_PROCESS}.
\item Pass the child to the inherited feature
  \Efeature[POSIX_CURRENT_PROCESS]{fork} and the forking has begun.
\stopitemize

\placefigure
  []
  [bon:exforkone]
  {BON diagram of forking a child process.}
  {\externalfigure[exforkone]}

The following class shows the process that forks the child.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_fork1.e}

This class just displays anything that the writer, the child class,
writes to the \cap{FIFO}. When it recognizes stop, the reader stops
after waiting for the child it has spawned. Note that this is very
important! Wait for any child you have spawned else you might get
spurious errors if the process exits and a child has not yet finished.

The following class shows the forked child.

\typeEIFFELfile{fork_child.e}




\chapter{Querying the operating system}

\section{Current time}

\eposix has a very complete class to work with times. A time can be
set from the current time by using
\Efeature[POSIX_TIME]{make_from_now}. Before a time can be printed, it
needs to be converted to either local time or \cap{utc}. Do this by
calling \Efeature{to_local} or \Efeature{to_utc}. Date and
times can be printed using features as \Efeature{default_format},
\Efeature{local_date_string}, \Efeature{local_time_string} or a custom
format through \Efeature{format}.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_time1.e}


\section{Accessing environment variables}

Standard C supports reading environment variables with
\Eclass{STDC_ENV_VAR}.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_env2.e}

The \cap{posix} doesn't add any functionality here:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_env1.e}

It is not possible in \cap{posix} to set an environment variable. This
is possible with the Single Unix Specification classes.  Using
\Efeature{SUS_ENV_VAR}{set_value} it is possible to set
\index{environment variable+set}environment variables.


\section{Capabilities}

Use the portable \Eclass{EPX_SYSTEM} class to query for various system
dependent constants like \Eclass{max_open_files}. There are operating
system dependent queries in \Eclass{POSIX_SYSTEM} and
\Eclass{WINDOWS_SYSTEM}.




\chapter{Working with the network}

\section{MIME parsing}

Many of the Internet's protocols send data in MIME format. \eposix\
offers a MIME parser in \Eclass{EPX_MIME_PARSER} to parse such data
and MIME message creation in \Eclass{EPX_MIME_PART}.

MIME messages consist of two parts: a header and a body. The body
itself can consist of another header and body. Some examples of using
this class are shown in \in{section}[sec:smtp].


\section{Sockets}

\eposix\ currently has fairly complete socket support. Not every
option offered by the Single Unix Specification is supported yet, but
as always we will attempt in every release to reach full support for
every function offered.

As usual the EPX_XXXX classes are available on both Unix and Windows
platform. The SUS_XXXX classes are available only on Single Unix
Specification (\posix) systems and extend the EPX_XXXX classes with
Unix specific functionality.

TCP functionality is available for both Windows and Unix. UDP is only
available on Unix, as well as Unix streams.


\section{Echo client}

The following example demonstrates a simple echo client for TCP. An
echo server must be running on your machine:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_echo_client_tcp.e}

The following example demonstrates a simple echo client for UDP. An
echo server must be running on your machine:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_echo_client_udp.e}


\section{Echo client and server}

The following class demonstrates an echo server and client in a single
class. It uses unix sockets (a fast interprocess communication) to
achieve that.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_echo_unix.e}

The following class is similar, but uses TCP.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_echo_tcp.e}




\chapter[sec:sus]{Working with the network: advanced topics}


\section{Introduction}

In version 2.0 \eposix\ has introduced the first of a series of
classes for writing common Internet clients and servers.

Many of these classes are a work in progress, and might not have the
robustness desired for critical applications.

\section{FTP client}

The \eposix\ FTP client supports almost all FTP operations, but
currently has a fairly basic interface. Read and write operations
return a stream for example. Reading and writing files to the file
system is left as an exercise for the reader.

The following example demonstrates reading a directory from an FTP
server and receiving a file:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_ftp1.e}

\Eclass{EXP_FTP_CLIENT} also supports creating
(\Efeature{make_directory}) or deleting directories
(\Efeature{remove_directory}), deleting (\Efeature{remove_file}),
renaming (\Efeature{rename_to}), and uploading files (\Efeature{store}).


\section{HTTP client}

The following example demonstrates retrieval of a file through HTTP
using the \Eclass{EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT} class:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_http1.e}

It also demonstrates the use of the \Eclass{UT_URI} class to parse an
\index{URI}URI into its components.


\section{HTTP server}

\eposix\ offers a basic HTTP server in \Eclass{EPX_HTTP_SERVER}. The
followng example demonstrates starting such a server and let it listen
on the local interface.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_http_server1.e}

\Eclass{EPX_HTTP_SERVER} will say to clients that it serves XHTML
instead of HTML. Or in MIME types: \type{application/xhtml+xml}
instead of \type{text/html}. In case that the HTML pages which are
served are not actually XHTML, you will need to turn this option off
with a call to \Efeature{set_serve_xhtml_if_supported}.

In the main loop all available requests are served after which a brief
sleep follows. Without the sleep the process would use 100\%
CPU.

The server will return the files under \filename{/var/www/html} from
the file system to the browser. It's also possible to create and
register \index{servlet}servlets which can respond to requests. A
servlet is like a built-in CGI program. A servlet allows maximum
control over the response send to the browser, not only the response
header, but also the response code send to the client.

A servlet is built after \index{REST}REST principles. A servlet is
designed to behave like a resource. You can bind it to a URL and after
that it can handle any of the HTTP commands as GET, POST, or
\index{PUT request}PUT that are send to it. By default a servlet will
return error code 405, meaning ``Method not allowed''. The simplest
servlet, which always returns 405 is therefore the following:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_http_servlet1.e}

This servlet has to be registered with the HTTP server. The following
example shows a virtual HTTP server, one that doesn't have a document
root and therefore will never read the file system. It attaches the
servlet to the url \filename{/customers}.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_http_server2.e}

You might have noticed it attached servlet
\Eclass{EX_HTTP_SERVLET2}. This servlet is shown below:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_http_servlet2.e}

Only the \Efeature[EX_HTTP_SERVLET]{get_header} method needs to be
overwritten. The format is usually to write the body first and write
the header last. This might seem counter-intuitive, but for persistent
connections you need to supply a \index{Content-Length}Content-Length
if you write a body. Another solution would be to use the chunked
transfer encoding, but that isn't explicitly supported yet, so you
have to do the work yourself here.

So for dynamically created content, you usually write the body in the
header, so you can setup the header. There is also a
\Efeature[EX_HTTP_SERVLET]{get_body}, but it is usually not overriden
for dynamic content.

The \Eclass{EPX_HTTP_SERVER} class is responsible for sending the
header and the body and to guard against any errors.

In the same manner you can write code to react to PUT, POST or
\index{DELETE request}DELETE requests. As browsers usually do not
support PUT or DELETE requests, \Eclass{EPX_HTTP_CONNECTION} will turn
a POST request into a PUT or DELETE when it finds a special value. The
implementation is in \Efeature{remap_http_method}. This happens under
the following circumstances:

\startitemize[n]
\item The request is a POST request.
\item The POST request is a submit of form fields (regardless of the
  chosen encoding).
\item There is a form field that starts with the name ``http-method:''.
\stopitemize

In these cases the substring after ``http-method:'' is taken to
override the POST request into whatever is present as substring.

\in{Figure}[bon:httpserver] shows the BON diagram of the
\Eclass{EPX_HTTP_SERVER}. A server can have zero or more registered
servlets and zero or more open connections.

\placefigure
  []
  [bon:httpserver]
  {BON diagram of \simpleEclass{EPX_HTTP_SERVER}.}
  {\externalfigure[epxhttpserver]}

The server supports persistent connections. In HTTP/1.1 connections
are persistent by default. If not requested otherwise, the server will
keep the connection open and monitor it to see if any data is coming
in. If no data has been send in the last 15 seconds, the connection is
forcibly closed.

The server can have zero or more servlets registered. A single servlet
can be connected to multiple URLs by calling
\Efeature[EPX_HTTP_SERVER]{register_fixed_resource} with the same
servlet.

There is also a \Efeature{register_dynamic_resource} call to register
servlets where part of the data is present in the URL. For example the
URL \filename{/customer/1} looks much better than
\filename{/customer?id=1}. Register a servlet that takes part of the
URL as input as follows:

\startEIFFEL
server.register_dynamic_resource ("/customer/(id)", servlet)
\stopEIFFEL

Every name present between parentheses in such a path is appended to
\Efeature[EPX_HTTP_CONNECTION]{request_form_fields}. To a servlet it
does therefore not matter if a query is used to input the data, if it
is part of a POST or if it was part of the URL. It all becomes input
data.


\section{IMAP4 client}

\eposix\ implements an IMAP4 client that supports IMAP4 access.
The following example connects to an IMAP4 server and performs various
operations:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_imap41.e}

The first operation is reading the list of available folders.. Next it
examines the standard INBOX folder, i.e. open it for reading only. It
reads message 4 and prints it. And finally it closes the mailbox.

The \eposix\ IMAP4 is fairly full featured, it can read and write
messages and receive various pieces of information about the email
such as just its header ot its size.


\section{IRC client}

\eposix\ also has an IRC client implementation,
\Eclass{EPX_IRC_CLIENT}. The following example demonstrates logging on
to the \type{#eiffel} channel on \filename{irc.freenode.net} and
printing all the messages.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_irc1.e}

The printing is done by calling
\Efeature[EPX_IRC_CLIENT]{set_print_response}. Not something you
probably will use except when debugging. Also we set
\Efeature{set_blocking_io} to True, but real IRC clients will be
non-blocking.

Look at the test class \Eclass{TEST_IRC_CLIENT} for more examples, or
download the Eiffel Bot from the \eposix\ page.


\section[sec:smtp]{SMTP client}

\Eclass{EPX_SMTP_CLIENT} implements support for sending email to an
SMTP server. It only supports servers that can receive 8 bit messages.
This class cannot convert 8 bit data to 7 bit data.

\section{Sending plain text email}

The following example demonstrates sending a plain text email with
this class:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_smtp1.e}

There are three steps in creating an email:
\startitemize[n]
\item Create the message using \Eclass{EPX_MIME_EMAIL}, which
  basically is an \Eclass{EPX_MIME_PART}. It has and has several
  convenience routines to quickly create such a message.
\item Create the mail using \Eclass{EX_SMTP_MAIL}. This class is a
  container for the sender, the recipients and the actual message that
  is to be sent.
\item Create an instance of the \Eclass{EPX_SMTP_CLIENT} class. The
  \Efeature[EPX_SMTP_CLIENT]{ehlo} command identifies the client with
  the server. Pass as argument the local domain, or if this is not
  available, the ip address of the client. The actual message is send
  after calling the \Efeature{mail} command. It's argument is the
  Eclass{EPX_SMTP_MAIL} instance created in the previous step.\par
\stopitemize

After the message has been sent, \Efeature[EPX_SMTP_CLIENT]{quit} is
called to end the session and \Efeature{close} is called to close the
connection with the SMPT server.

The creation routine of \Eclass[EPX_SMTP_CLIENT] takes as argument the
SMTP server. Correctly finding the SMTP server for a given recipient
involves querying a DNS server for MX records. \eposix\ does not
support this at the moment. However, passing the local SMTP server is
usually sufficient as this server knows how to figure this out.

\section{Sending \cap{html} email}

The following example demonstrates sending an \HTML\ text email with
this class:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_smtp2.e}

The main difference is setting the content type to be ``text/hmtl''.
And the body must be \HTML\ of course.


\section{Sending both text and \cap{html} email}

As not all email clients can display \HTML, most mailers send both a
text and an \HTML\ version. The following example demonstrates how
this can be done in \eposix:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_smtp3.e}

We set the content type to be ``multipart/alternative'', and
create two parts. The first part is content type ``text/plain'' and
the second is the content type ``text/html''.


\section{LDIF parser}

\eposix\ contains an \index{LDIF}LDIF (\index{LDAP}LDAP Data
Interchange Format) parser, see RFC 2849.




\chapter{Writing daemons}

\section{Introduction}

\eposix\ has several classes that help with writing daemons or
services. First of all there is the \Eclass{POSIX_DAEMON} ancestor
class. But as daemons have no user interface, there are also classes
for error and information logging.


\section{Windows}

On Windows NT (and derivatives) the equivalent of unix daemons are
called services. They are a lot harder to write and require an Eiffel
compiler with multi-threading. It is not yet possible to write an NT
service with \eposix.

The logging functionality described in this chapter does work on
Windows NT though.


\section{Creating a daemon}

Creating a simple daemon is easy if you inherit from
\Eclass{POSIX_DAEMON}. Implement the \Efeature{execute} method, and
you're done. At run||time, call \Efeature{detach} to fork off a
child. You can call \Efeature{detach} as many times as you want to
spawn daemons.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_daemon.e}


\section[sec:syslog]{Logging messages and errors}

Although \cap{posix} doesn't have logging facilities, the Single Unix
Specification does. This specification requires the presence of the
\filename{syslogd} daemon for centralizes logging facilities. The
following example shows you to write messages to this daemon

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_syslog.e}

Always use the \Eclass{SUS_SYSLOG_ACCESSOR} to access the syslog
wrapper class \Eclass{SUS_SYSLOG}. \Eclass{SUS_SYSLOG} is a singleton,
it makes no sense to open a connection to the syslog daemon twice.


\section[sec:ulm]{ULM based logging}

\eposix\ has portable routines for logging in Windows NT and
Unix. This is build using the ULM (\infull{ULM}) specification. The
specification itself can be found at \from[ulm]. It is a fixed format
for logging that makes it easier to extract data with other tools.

On Unix \eposix\ outputs messages to the syslog daemon, see
\in{section}[sec:syslog]. On Windows \eposix\ logs to the event
log. This makes this kind of logging specific to Windows NT based
systems. It will not work on Windows 9x based systems.

Below a short example of using ULM. The first step is to create a
handler that does the actual logging. The class
\Eclass{EPX_LOG_HANDLER} is operating system specific. If you compile
on Windows it gives NT event log logging, on Unix it gives syslog
logging. There is no logging mechanism for Windows 9x, but it should
not be hard to write one. Just implement \Eclass{ULM_LOG_HANDLER} and
implement the deferred routines.

The second step is connecting that handler to the class that does ULM
logging, the \Eclass{ULM_LOGGING} class. Logging is now set up.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_ulm.e}

Two messages are written. Below the slightly formatted output Unix:

\starttyping
Jul 21 21:12:34 dellius example: DATE=20030721091234 \
  HOST=dellius.nederware.nl PROG="ex_ulm.none" LVL=Alert \
  MSG="Hello World."
Jul 21 21:12:34 dellius example: DATE=20030721091234 \
  HOST=dellius.nederware.nl PROG="ex_ulm" LVL=Usage \
  SRC.IP=127.0.0.1
\stoptyping

The first message is in the default format. This will always log the
date, the host where the message originated and the program. The
program field, \cap{prog}, consists of a system and subsystem name,
separated by dots. This subsystem name is the second parameter to
\Efeature[ULM_LOGGING]{log_message}. It may be Void, in which case no
subsystem is added to the system name. The level field, \cap{lvl},
contains the importance of the message. It is the first parameter to
\Efeature[ULM_LOGGING]{log_message}. The class \Eclass{ULM_LOG_LEVELS}
has the complete list of levels. And in most cases the log ends with a
simple message, \cap{msg}, that contains the message itself.

Feature \Efeature[ULM_LOGGING]{log_event} allows more control over the
fields that are logged. That is demonstrated in the second
message. You can pass the fields that are logged. You can use the
fields listed in \from[ulm], or any other field. There is no \cap{MSG}
field if you don't specify one.

An interesting application of the \cap{ulm} specification is the
NetLogger library, see \from[netlogger]. It is a protocol to measure
response times for a distributed application.

On Windows NT you can use the supplied \filename{messages.dll} file to
avoid this message in the event log:

\starttyping
The description for Event ID ( some_number4 ) in Source
( some_name ) cannot be found. The local computer may not have
the necessary registry information or message DLL files to
display messages from a remote computer.
\stoptyping

Register this DLL under the
\filename{HKLM/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/Eventlog/Application}
key. Add a new key which should have the name you have supplied to the
\Efeature[EPX_LOG_HANDLER]{make} routine. This key should have two
values:
\startitemize[n]
\item EventMessageFile, type REG_SZ. Its value is the full path to this
  messages.dll file.
\item TypesSupported, type DWORD. Its value should be 7.
\stopitemize




\chapter[sec:internet]{Writing \CGI\ programs}

Although writing a \index{cgi}\cap{cgi} program doesn't really belong
to \cap{posix}, they still are very common, so I decided to include a
few classes to make this easier. And of course, they build upon the
Standard C classes.

\placefigure
  []
  [bon:cgi]
  {BON diagram of \simpleEclass{EPX_CGI}.}
  {\externalfigure[cgi]}

You inherit from \Eclass{EPX_CGI} and implement \Efeature{execute}. As
\Eclass{EPX_CGI} itself inherits from \Eclass{EPX_XHTML_WRITER} you
can call use the features of that class to generate XHTML.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_cgi1.e}

Output is accumulated in a string and written to stdout after your
\Efeature[EPX_CGI]{execute} method has finished. The partially built
string is accessible with
\Efeature[EPX_XML_WRITER]{unfinished_xml}. Generated output is
\cap{xhtml}, which usually displays fine with older browsers. If
strict \cap{xhtml} is problematic, you can call
\Efeature{doctype_transitional} instead of \Efeature{doctype}.

It is important not to write to stdout as the output is only written
after your \Efeature[EPX_CGI]{execute} has finished. If you want to
write something to standard output, use the
\Efeature[EPX_CGI]{add_data} feature or its shortcut alias
\Efeature{puts}. If you want to write real tags, use
\Efeature{add_raw}. This last feature allows you to write anything,
while \Efeature{puts} escapes reserved characters like '>'.

If you use provided features like \Efeature{b_a}, \Efeature{b_p} and
such, an attempt is made to produce good looking source. Also your
input is somewhat validated against \cap{xhtml} standards.

It is also easy to write a \cap{cgi} program that displays a form and
accepts submitted values. Even \index{cgi+file upload}file upload is
supported. The following example uses the GET method to submit
data:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_cgi2.e}

You can use \Efeature[EPX_CGI]{b_input} to start an input element as
shown for the input of a name. Or you can use \Efeature{input_text} to
start a simple text input as shown for the input of a city. Below the
line you see the value a user has submitted, if any. Use
\Efeature{value} to get values with certain meta||characters
removed. The output is still not save to be passed straight to a Unix
Shell though! You can use \Efeature{raw_value} to get the contents as
submitted by the user.

In the above example it doesn't matter much if you use
\Efeature{b_form_get} or \Efeature{b_form_post}. But with the GET
method, you cannot upload files. The following example demonstrates
how files can be uploaded:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_cgi3.e}

It is important to set the encoding type. This example accepts a file
and writes it to \filename{/tmp}. Because multiple files can be
present, this example just loops over all key value pairs and checks
if a file is present. This example isn't fool||proof with
multiple users submitting the same file, but you should get the idea.

Note that the first line is \Efeature[EPX_CGI]{content_text_html}: in case
an exception occurs, the web server is still able to output something
back to the user.

After that we make sure that the key value pairs are created with
\Efeature{assert_key_value_pairs_created}. They are automatically
created if you call \Efeature{value}, but in this case we want the key
value pairs themselves. In \Efeature[EX_CGI3]{save_uploaded_files} we
use the \Efeature[EPX_KEYVALUE]{file} feature to check if that key
value pair is an uploaded file: if it is not Void, it points to a
\index{temporary file}temporary file. As this file will be deleted
when it is closed or when your program exits, we have to copy it to a
new file. The filename is just the value part of this key value pair.
The filename is guaranteed to be free of directory parts.

In the last example we just \index{cgi+enumerating all values}print all
key/value pairs to the file \filename{list.txt} in the temporary
directory. We \index{cgi+redirect}redirect the user to another file.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_cgi4.e}




\chapter[sec:errorhandling]{Error handling}

This chapter describes the \index{error handling}error handling
strategies that are possible with \eposix. Basically there are two
strategies: using the Eiffel exception mechanism or doing the error
handling all yourself.

\section{Error handling with exceptions}

The opinion of the author of \eposix\ is that Eiffel's exception
mechanism is very well suited to deal with things like files that
cannot be opened or directories that do not exist. Others disagree,
see \in{section}[sec:manualerrorhandling]. \eposix\ is designed such
that when a \cap{posix} routine returns an error code, an exception is
thrown. Here my arguments why I favor this style of error handling:
\startitemize[n]
\item We all know that exceptions are to be used for breach of
  contract. This idea is formulated in \cite[OOSC2] and is the best
  expressed opinion of exception handling I know.\par
  So if you ask an \eposix\ method to open a file, it will do that for
  you. If it cannot open the file, for whatever reason, it will raise
  an exception. The same argument hold if you ask it to go to a
  directory, to start a program, or to open a connection to another
  machine.\par
  This approach is also reflected in the names of \eposix's
  features. The name is \Efeature[POSIX_TEXT_FILE]{open_read} and not
  \Efeature[POSIX_TEXT_FILE]{attempt_open_read}.
\item It is usually not wise to trust clients with error handling. The
  larger a distance between a software failure and the error report,
  the more difficult it is to make a correct diagnosis of what went
  wrong (see \cite[Hatton2001a]). \eposix\ uses the fail early, fail
  hard approach.
\item Error handling is often forgotten or left to some global general
  error handling mechanism. In an interesting article
  (see \cite[Whittaker2001a]) James Whittaker describes how he
  modified certain system calls to return legitimate, but unexpected
  return codes. Memory allocation failed for example, or opening a
  file returned with no more file handles. Applications failed within
  seconds, but it was usually completely unclear why.
\item It's a lot easier for programmer's. You don't have to write any
  error handling. If your program completed, you know that there wasn't
  a single system call that failed, that you didn't continue despite
  some error. This will make it possible to write programs that do their
  work correctly if no errors occur, or else do nothing.
\stopitemize

First an example. Let's take a look at the code you have to write in
case you want to handle failure of opening a file:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_error1.e}

In this example we try to create a file exclusively. The create will
fail if the file already exists. In case this happens, we retry 3
times. Before retrying we wait 1 second. Note that if the error is not
\cdefine{EEXIST}, we fail directly, without retrying.

In my opinion above's code is just the code you want to write usually:
do not worry about errors, if something goes wrong, your application
will fail.

My preferred way of error handling is (or sometimes should be) also
reflected in the preconditions. For example the
\Efeature[POSIX_FILE_SYSTEM]{browse_directory} has the precondition
that the given path should exist and should be a directory. Quite
reasonable I think. The argument against such preconditions is that
it is somewhat strange: if a client has honoured the precondition by
checking that the directory exists, it should be able to assume that
it safely can call the routine. But between its own check and the
actual call, the directory can be removed by another process.

This is the concurrent precondition paradox (see \cite[OOSC2]). In my
opinion it would not be wise to remove this precondition. It is true
that honouring it, will not make sure the contract is not broken. But
it still serves a very usefull purpose: documentation.

For example the routine \Efeature[POSIX_FILE_SYSTEM]{remove_file} does
not have the precondition that the file should exist. That isn't an
oversight. This routine does not fail if the file no longer exists for
good reason: it honours its postcondition after all. So when you call
this routine, the file may or may not exist. The routine doesn't care.

\section[sec:manualerrorhandling]{Manual error handling}

In spite of the arguments listed in the previous section, automatic
error handling is perhaps tedious to use when you expect a lot of
errors. And some programmers just do not like Eiffel's exception
mechanism. Therefore \eposix\ implements a completely different style
of error handling. In this case, \eposix\ continues when an error
occurs, but it safes the errorcode, and you can check the errorcode of
the first error when you wish. This first errorcode has to be reset by
the programmer. An example:

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_error2.e}

Exception handling is turned off by a call to
\Efeature[STDC_SECURITY_ACCESSOR]{security.error_handling.disable_exceptions}.
It can be enabled again by calling
\Efeature{security.error_handling.enable_exceptions}. In between,
you're on your own, just like a C programmer. If \filename{myfile}
cannot be opened, nothing happens, and the
\Efeature[POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR]{put_string} feature is
called. Depending if you have enabled precondition checking or not,
\Efeature{put_string} will fail. The precondition if
\Efeature{put_string} is that the file has to be open. Therefore, at
certain points, you're still forced to deal with errors. Every object
has an \Efeature{errno} variable. This variable points to the global
\Efeature{STDC_ERRNO} object (its a once routine). So there basically
is just one \Efeature{first_value} error value. Whatever object caused
the error, you can check the \Efeature{errno.first_value} of any
\eposix\ object. The last error is still available in
\Efeature{errno.value}.

If there is no error, the program continues writing. If
\Efeature[POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR]{put_string} failed, the next one is
still executed. If there is an error, we reset it with
\Efeature[STDC_ERRNO]{clear_first}. This gives us the chance to catch
another error value if an error occurs. If this method is not called,
\Efeature{first_value} will keep its original value.

The following example is the same as \Eclass{EX_ERROR1}. It shows how
to open a file exclusively with manual error handling.

\typeEIFFELfile{ex_error3.e}

As you can see, manual error handling does not necessarily translate
into less code.

The summary of this section is that you chould check each distinctive
step when using manual error handling. You don't have to check
intermediate steps.




\chapter[sec:security]{Security}

\eposix\ is well||suited to write server applications like \cap{cgi}
scripts and daemons. As these applications can be hosted on servers
that are attached to the Internet, they could be prone to
attack. Applications written with \eposix\ could be misused in a
denial of service attack or to gain root access. \eposix\ offers
certain protection mechanisms that enable your applications to
fend off such penetrations.

This chapter shows you how applications can be misused and what
mechanisms \eposix\ offers for certain attacks.

\startquotation
Programmers typically focus on "positive" aspects of programs, that is,
what is the functionality required for the task to be accomplished.
Programmers rarely focus on the negative aspects of programs, that is,
what functionality is not required for the program to accomplish its
task.  Attackers take advantage of proggrammers failure to consider
negative functionality.  Perhaps a reason that programmers avoid
negative functionality is that there is no good way to specify what a
program should not be permitted to do.
\stopquotation

% quote here? Programmers usually focus more on what is needed that
% what is not needed.


\section{Denial of service attacks}

In a denial of service attack, crackers attempt to deplete one or more
finite resources. Resources can be software related like database
connections or \cap{tcp/ip} connections, but ultimately resources are
finite because of hardware limitations. This manual distinguishes the
following hardware resources:
\startitemize
\item Memory.
\item CPU.
\item Disk space.
\item Network bandwidth.
\stopitemize

A denial of service attack succeeds if a cracker depletes these
resources in such a way that the server cannot handle request anymore,
or handles them very slowly. For example, Linux 2.2 is easy to bring
to its knees if you keep on allocating memory. In normal situations
your application runs fine, and allocates only a limited amount of
memory. But an attacker might have found a way to make your
application allocate much more memory. Even if you are sure that the
code you have written is not prone to such an attack, you might use a
library based on \eposix\ that does have code that is exploitable.

\eposix\ has some limited support to set limits on memory, file handle
(a memory issue) and cpu usage. When a set limit has been exceeded, an
exception is raised.

To limit the amount of memory that can be allocated by the
\Eclass{STDC_BUFFER} class, inherit from
\Eclass{STDC_SECURITY_ACCESSOR} and call
\Efeature{security.memory.set_max_allocation}. Currently this limits
the amount of memory that can be allocated with
\Eclass{STDC_BUFFER}. It does not limit the amount of memory that is
allocated by \Eclass{STRING} or other classes. You can also limit the
amount of memory that can be allocated with a single call by calling
\Efeature{security.memory.set_max_single_allocation}.

You can limit the number of file handles a program can open by calling
\Efeature{security.files.set_max_open_files}. This works only with
files and sockets opened by \eposix\ classes as \Eclass{STDC_FILE} and
\Eclass{POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}, not with files opened through other
means. In this case you cannot rely on the garbage collection to close
your file. Certain garbage collectors do not allow calling other
classes in the \Efeature[MEMORY]{dispose} method. \eposix\ needs to do
this to decrement its idea of the number of open handles. Only when
you explicitly call \Efeature[STDC_FILE]{close} will the \eposix\
decrease its open file handles.

You can limit the amount of CPU time by calling
\Efeature{security.cpu.set_max_process_time}. It is not possible to
automatically halt your application when this time has exceeded. You
have to call \Efeature{security.cpu.check_process_time} to actually
check the processor time used.

Currently \eposix\ cannot check disk space or network bandwidth
limitations.

{\tt Discuss here that decrementing only works for manual
deallocations, I'm very sorry about that, but this is a problem of
ISE. I'm thinking about ways to work around this.}


\section{Authorization bypass attacks}

A hacker can bypass authorization if he or she, through your program,
can gain the following access:
\startitemize
\item Access to more information than your program is written to
  provide. Security is not breached here, but your program is used in
  an `innovative' way. Note that if your program runs within the root
  security context (suid root), security can be breached!
\item Security is breached when your program is used to get more
  access rights than your program is written to provide. Especially
  suid root programs are an attractive target here.
\stopitemize

Usually Eiffel programs do not allocate buffers on the stack, so they
are not prone to the so called `buffer overflow' attack. As certain
vendors might provide some `native' class that allocate things on the
stack, leave precondition checking always on in suid root programs.

Currently \eposix\ doesn't offer much protection for suid root
programs. Much better security will be the topic of a next release.

%Or:
% reading more than allowed.
% writing more than allowed.
% executing other than allowed programs.
% other exploitable attacks?

% discuss common attachs:
% - buffer overflow
% - stack overflow

% - test for poison nul, what happens if I get a /etc/passwd%0test file?
%   does eiffel see this as /etc/passwd%0test? If passed to C you get /etc/passwd...
% how to protect against this? Filter out %0 in CGI?
% or better yet, refuse to open such a filename... i.e. one with
% strange characters: good stuff for my STDC_PATH thing




\chapter[sec:cheader]{Accessing C headers}

This chapter explains the conventions that \eposix\ uses to access the
C||headers.

\section{Making C Headers available to Eiffel}

The most portable and safest header translation comes when a C
function is not called verbatim, but instead a translation function is
used. For example to make the Standard C function \posix{fopen}
available within Eiffel a new header file is created which lists an
Eiffel compatible way to call this routine:

\starttyping
#include "eiffel.h"
#include <stdio.h>

EIF_POINTER posix_fopen(EIF_POINTER filename, EIF_POINTER mode);
\stoptyping

Instead of using C types, we use Eiffel types here, which are made
available by including \myheader{eiffel.h}.

The corresponding C file contains the following implementation:

\starttyping
#include "my_new_header.h"

EIF_POINTER posix_fopen(EIF_POINTER filename, EIF_POINTER mode)
{
  return ( (EIF_POINTER) fopen (filename, mode));
}
\stoptyping

It simply calls the original function, returning the result. Type
conversion between Eiffel and C types shouldn't pose problems this
way.

To be able to call this function from Eiffel, an
\Ekeyword{external} feature needs to be written. For example:

\startEIFFEL
class HEADER_STDIO

feature {NONE} -- C binding for stream functions

   posix_fopen (path, a_mode: POINTER): POINTER is
         -- Opens a stream
      require
         valid_mode: a_mode /= default_pointer
      external "C"
      end

end
\stopEIFFEL

Of course, the Eiffel function can have all Design By Contract
features Eiffel programmers are accustomed too.

To recapitulate: every header that is to be translated, needs:
\startitemize[n]
\item a new header file, and
\item a corresponding C file, and
\item an Eiffel class.
\stopitemize

For example to translate \header{stdio.h} a header file like
\filename{eiffel_stdio.h} and a C file \filename{eiffel_stdio.c} is
needed. The Eiffel class could be in \filename{header_stdio.e}.


\section{Distinction between Standard C and \cap{posix} headers}

However, \cap{posix} sometimes defines extensions to existing Standard
C headers. Simply using a translation header file like
\filename{eiffel_stdio.h} will not work for pure Standard C Eiffel
programs, as it can include \cap{posix} specific extensions that might
simply not be available on a given platform.

Therefore, \eposix\ divides the C headers in several groups:
\startitemize[n]
\item The Standard C headers.
\item The \cap{posix} headers.
\item The Single Unix Specification headers.
\item Microsoft Windows headers (as far as they define \cap{posix}
  functions, this library does not translate Microsoft Windows
  specific functions).
\stopitemize

Every group gets its own translation header with its own prefix. A
translated header has a prefix, an underscore and next the original
header name. The Standard C translation of \header{stdio.h} is done in
\myheader{c_stdio.h} and \myheader{c_stdio.c}. The \cap{posix}
extensions to this header are available in \myheader{p_stdio.h} and
\myheader{p_stdio.c}.

The corresponding Eiffel class follows similar conventions. It has the
group's prefix, next the string `API', an underscore and next the name
of the header. So all \header{stdio.h} functions are made available in
\Eclass{CAPI_STDIO}.

In \in{table}[table:prefixconventions] all the groups with there
translation header prefix and Eiffel class prefix are listed. See also
the directory structure in \in{figure}[fig:directory2].

\section{C translation details}

This translation wants to do as less as possible at the C level. It
attempts to just make available the C constants and C functions and do
the actual work in Eiffel.

A few details:
\startitemize[n]
\item Constants, C macro definitions, are exported in the header file with the
  prefix `const_' and next the macro name. The Eiffel API class
  exports these constants with the original, uppercased name.
\item Struct members are exported with getter and setter
  functions. The get function has the prefix `posix', an underscore,
  the struct name, an underscore and as last the member name. The set
  function has the prefix `posix', an underscore, `set', an
  underscore, the struct name, an underscore and as last the member
  name.

The following table defines exactly where a given Posix function is

EPX_ classes. The EPX_ classes provide functionality portable between
Unix and Windows. The corresponding POSIX_ or SUS_ classes extend that

    Killing subprocesses works sometimes, but not always.\par
    Remove exception handling just before execvp?\par
\item how about capture to /dev/null?
\item can we capture i/o for every forked process? If so, move this code
    to POSIX_FORK_ROOT.
\item Perhaps option to influence environment variables to pass to
  subprocess?
\stopitemize


\section{\simpleEclass{POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}}
\startitemize[n]
\item possible to open exclusively and so?
\item complete support for nonblocking i/o.
\stopitemize


\section{\simpleEclass{POSIX_MEMORY_MAP}}
\startitemize[n]
\item Cannot change protection.
\item No locking.
\stopitemize


\section{\simpleEclass{POSIX_SEMAPHORE}}
\startitemize[n]
\item not valid for named semaphore I think.
\item have to add various close/unlink functions.
\stopitemize


\section{\simpleEclass{POSIX_SIGNAL}}
\startitemize[n]
\item Add synchronous waiting for signals like \posix{sigwait}.
\item (Re)enable sending Eiffel exception on signal?
  i.e. set_exception_handler or so.
\item Resend signal as Eiffel exception in signal handler.
\stopitemize


\section{\simpleEclass{POSIX_STATUS}}
\startitemize[n]
\item return STDC_TIME instead of unix time
\item Not all stat member fields are currently available.
\stopitemize


\section{\simpleEclass{POSIX_MQUEUE}}
\startitemize[n]
\item Solaris x86 says it supports it, so have to work on that.
\stopitemize


\section{Security}
Add base security class that specifies programs intent. Default is to
allow anything, but security can be tightened:
\startitemize[n]
\item Call to \posix{open} or \posix{creat} (used?), use real user id,
  not effective user id.
\item Assume we're free from buffer attacks if preconditions are
  enabled.
\item exec/system call only allowed when effective user is not root,
  unless otherwise specified. Or exec only allowed for specific files.
\item Protect against writing specific files/directories. Perhaps
  substitute vulnerable filenames for other ones.
\item Emulate atomic calls. Or add atomic \posix{access} and
  \posix{open} call. Shouldn't be done by setting su??
\item When appending/writing to files, check if symbolic link.
\item \Efeature[ABSTRACT_FILE_SYSTEM]{force_remove_directory} is
  potentially unsafe because it follows links so it can be used to
  destroy things not under that directory.
\item remove tmpnam function.
\item Make sure the once functions in STDC_BASE are called from within
  the security initialization, so they're allocated and do not
  generate an out-of-memory exception themselves.
\stopitemize

Idea from \quote{Remediation of Application Specific Security
Vulnerabilities at Runtime} article in IEEE Computer sep/oct 2000.


\section{Windows code}

\startitemize[n]
\item chmod also available on Windows.
\item Add permissions to status: read/write.
\item set_binary_mode should do something for the posix factory, i.e.,
  when compiling with cygwin. Perhaps separate \Eclass{CYGWIN_API} or
  so in \cap{posix} dir with the window specific stuff.\par
  Currently cygwin uses text mode for file descriptors, the windows
  variant uses binary.
\item utime can be supported by using SetFileTime.
\stopitemize

\section{Other}
\startitemize[n]
\item remove ugly const_ prefix from constants. Uppercase should be good
  enough.\par
  Almost done, only const_EOF remains, not easy to replace perhaps.
\item Compare POSIX_SIGNAL with ISE UNIX_SIGNAL: They have an
  is_caught function, useful? Means this signal generates an exception.
\stopitemize


\section{Known bugs}
\startitemize
\item The error code is perhaps not always set for every
  \Efeature[STDC_BASE]{raise_posix_error}.
\item does STRING_HELPER leak memory in to_external? How is memory used
  for these conversions being freed? Is memory used there?
\item If a child process is signalled (terminated), the function
  \Efeature[POSIX_FORK_ROOT]{is_terminated_normally} sometimes returns
  True.
