		"Base class for other classes that create or get assigned a handle%
		%to an external resource like a file, socket or memory block. %
		%This class can become owner of the resource in which case it%
		%automatically closes the resource when garbage collected. It also%
		%contains protection against misuse of resources by checking against%
		%set limits.%
		%Postconditions that resource counting is correct, only work when the%
		%garbage collector does not kick in. Therefore, disable the gc if you%
		%want to test it or compile without a gc."
