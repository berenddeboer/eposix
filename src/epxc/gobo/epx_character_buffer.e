	description: "Gobo KI_CHARACTER_BUFER on top of STDC_BUFFER."

	implementation:
	"STDC_BUFFER is zero-based, while KI_CHARACTER_BUFFER is 1 based,%
	%care has been taken to map everything correctly, but there still%
	%might be some off-by-one errors lurking...%
	%And don't even think of mixing STDC_BUFFER calls with %
	%KI_CHARACTER_BUFFER calls!"
