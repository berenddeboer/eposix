			-- Can items be read from input stream?

	is_open_write: BOOLEAN

	is_streaming: BOOLEAN
			-- Is data coming from a network stream?


feature -- Access

	last_character: CHARACTER
			-- Last character read by `read_character' and a few other
			-- routines

	last_read: INTEGER
			-- Last bytes read by `read_buffer';
			-- Can be less than requested for non-blocking input.
			-- Check `last_blocked' in that case.

	last_string: STRING
			-- Last string read;
			-- (Note: this query always return the same object.
			-- Therefore a clone should be used if the result
			-- is to be kept beyond the next call to this feature.
			-- However `last_string' is not shared between file objects.)

	last_written: INTEGER
			-- How many bytes were written by the last call to a routine;
			-- Can be less than requested for non-blocking output.
			-- Check `last_blocked' in that case.


feature -- Stream or disk file

	set_streaming (enable: BOOLEAN)
			-- Influence behaviour of certain functions if they should be
			-- optimized for data coming from disk or data coming from
			-- the network. In particular `is_streaming' implies that a
			-- client application is prepared to handle `read's that
			-- return less than the requested number of bytes, but don't
			-- assume that means end-of-file.

			-- Forget the resource. Resource is not closed.
			-- You cannot read and write anymore.
