2010-09-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Release 3.2.1.


2010-09-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STC_TIME.to_local: wrong C code for 64 bit environments.

	* read_line: supports line length up to 8192 characters from 1024
	before truncating.


2010-05-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE.max_line_length: increased from 1024 to 8192.

2010-04-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CRYPTO_FEATURES: easy access to md5 calculation.


2010-04-27  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_11_CLIENT: parsing HTTP responses when chunked encoding
	was used, failed in about 1 out of 10 cases.


2010-04-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI.error_unauthorized: also emit body if set, not only
	header.


2010-01-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Release 3.2.0.

	* NET_LOGGER: format of log changed somewhat.


2009-12-25  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_TIME.to_utc: on FreeBSD errno was set after the first call,
	so explicitly reset errno.


2009-12-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_BUFFER: fix to handle case where body was larger than
	Content-Length was incorrect: still 1 character too much was read.


2009-11-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER.force_valid_string: Incorrect for character codes
	> 255...


2009-10-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Beta release 3.1.5.

	* Windows: Fixed EPX_CURRENT_PROCES and EPX_EXEC_PROCESS to take
	is_pid_valid changes into account.


2009-10-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT: Handle case where server doesn't send a
	response phrase, only a response code (i.e. only "HTTP/1.1 200"
	instead of "HTTP/1.1 200 OK").


2009-10-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Third beta release 3.1.4.


2009-06-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Second beta release 3.1.3.

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT.read_response_with_redirect: did not redirect
	if redirect was to a different server.

	* EPX_CHARACTER_BUFFER: adapted to change in KI_CHARACTER_BUFFER
	where `as_special' has become a deferred routine. And `as_special'
	must now return a value because of a change in
	YY_COMPRESSED_SCANNER_SKELETON which made it Void
	safe.

	* configure: fixed bug where gec was not recognised (reported by
	Colin Paul Adams).

	* configure: default compiler is now gec.


2009-06-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SUS_SYSLOG: buffer overflow possible (not on stack) when opening
	syslog.


2009-05-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_FILE_SYSTEM.mkdir: security change: newly created
	directories are now also accessible by everyone (formerly only by
	user) unless changed by the umask that is in effect.


2009-05-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_TCP_CLIENT_BASE.tcp_socket: postcondition failure even when
	exception on C call errors was turned off.


2009-03-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Rewrite of child/current process structure as weird things were
	happening. I think I didn't understand Eiffel's select mechanism
	very well.


2009-03-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_EMAIL.attach_file: new feature to attach a file to an
	email.

	* Manual: example how to attach files to an email.


2009-02-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_FILE_SYSTEM.is_directory: and basically everything that
	calls `abstract_access': this feature sets errno, and if something
	doesn't exist, it isn't really an error. So errno is now reset,
	else paths further in the code might inadvertedly think errno is
	set. Code that expects errno to be set afer this call, will
	break. It should call posix_access straight, instead of going
	through an abstraction function.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_SYSTEM.make_directories: new function to create
	more than 1 directory at once.


2009-02-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER.tag: new feature that can return the name of any
	parent element.


2009-01-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* First beta release 3.1.2.


2008-12-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Support for mingw32.


2008-11-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_EXEC_PROCESS: with this change the child didn't work on
	SmartEiffel. Somehow the current code trips up SE, so added some
	trickery to make this working again.


2008-11-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_EXEC_PROCESS: due to POSIX_FORK_ROOT.pid change, the pid was
	no longer the child pid.


2008-11-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_BUFFER.fill: possible invariant violation for chunked
	input.

	* Compiles on Windows again.


2008-11-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* POSIX_FORK_ROOT.pid: selected wrong features.


2008-10-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT.post: if data is set to form encoded and the
	body is not multiplart, it is assumed the body is already encoded
	in the proper format.

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT.read_response_with_redirect: did not submit
	body data when redirected.

	* EPX_MIME_PARSER: parsing MIME message without a body could lead
	to a postcondition failure.


2008-10-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* POSIX_GROUP.is_member: new feature


2008-10-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Alpha release 3.1.1.


2008-10-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MD5_CALCULATION: MD5 checksum support added.


2008-08-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_TCP_SOCKET.set_nodelay: set TCP_NODELAY option.

	* ABSTRACT_INTERNET_SOCKET: new features set_low_delay and
	set_throughput to minimize delay or maximise throughput

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT.put: remove wrong precondition that content
	type was only allowed to be one of two specific type.

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT.send_request: method made public to allow
	sending more kinds of verbs.


2008-08-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_BUFFER: implement twin and is_equal

	* EPX_HMAC_CALCULATION: HMAC calculation which can use SHA1 or
	MD5.

	* EPX_SHA1_CALCULATION: SHA1 calculation.


2008-08-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_BUFFER: new 64 bit integer read and write routines. Also
	optimised reading 32 bit integers and characters by using inline
	C.

	* STDC_BUFFER.put_character: new feature, more Eiffel like than
	poke_character.


2008-08-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Made sure all wipe_out calls call STRING_.wipe_out so they don't
	create new memory.


2008-08-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Fixed all catcalls reported by gec.


2008-08-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Support for VisualEiffel removed.

	* EPX_URL_ENCODING: inherits from UT_URL_ENCODING (Colin Paul
	Adams).

	* Updated config.guess and config.sub so newer OSes should be
	recognised better.

	* EPX_HTT_URI_RESOLVER.resolve: empty path resolves to "/" (Colin
	Paul Adams).


2008-07-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SUS_TEMPORARY_FILE: didn't properly set name with ISE Eiffel,
	so returned name was always the template, not the real temporary
	file name.


2008-06-25  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_ARRAY_HELPER: eposix have various issues on ISE o 64-bit
	platforms as it assumed a 4 byte pointer in this class (thanks
	Lennart Gustafsson).


2008-05-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT.delete: didn't accept data, but it
	should. Breaking change.


2008-05-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT.post: made a_post_data an optional parameter.


2008-05-27  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* p_unistd.c::posix_fork(): amended definition to use the special
	ISE fork routine in case multi-threading is enabled (Emmanuel Stapf).

	* EPX_SMTP_CLIENT: emit CRLF for single LF, just as the spec says.

	* EPX_CGI: emit 500 status on fatal error.


2008-05-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XHTML_WRITER: potential catcalls removed (Colin Paul Adams).


2008-04-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Changed eposix license to MIT.


2008-04-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Signal and exit handling rewritten. cecil no longer used, and it
	now works with gec as well.


2008-04-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_SYSTEM.time_zone_seconds: new feature to return the number
	of seconds between UTC and the local time zone.


2008-03-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_EMAIL_HEADER.set_bcc: new method


2008-03-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER: when a & is followed by a # it is assumed a
	character reference follows, so the & is not replaced by &amp;
	Previously character references were made invalid.


2008-01-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* NET_LOGGER_FIELD.is_valid: allow other characters than 7bit, so
	you can write UTF8 characters, saw no good reason to forbid that.


2008-01-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_STRING_INPUT_STREAM.read_string: didn't work, fix by Colin
	Paul Adams.


2008-01-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI.if_match and if_none_match: new feature to return value of
	If-Match and If-None-Match header.


2007-12-25  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SUS_SYSLOG: identification passed to syslog should be a pointer
	that remains valid. On ISE Eiffel the pointer was only temporary,
	leading to garbage in the log.

	* EPX_LOG_HANDLER: now based on the NetLogger classes. Breaking
	change!


2007-12-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* New NetLogger API classes for logging which replace the ULM
	classes (plug compatible).

	* ULM logging classes are obsolete, and no longer included by
	default in the library.xace.


2007-12-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Segment violation on Windows when using STDC_TIME.to_utc. Due
	to bug in posix_gmtime (Jocelyn).


2007-12-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_HTTP_HEADER.set_vary: set contents of Vary field.


2007-12-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT: now encodes spaces to + characters if a
	passed uri fragment contains them.


2007-11-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* src/spec/ge/EPX_STRING_HELPER: fixed compile issues for gec.

	* src/supportc/eiffel.h: gec fix: define EIF_INTEGER and such to
	the default values as gec doesn't define them.


2007-08-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI: Exception if no data was passed in a POST
	request. Probably a corner case, but I decided to accept such a
	request, basically there will be non key/value pairs, so clients
	can check for any required values if they consider this to be an
	error.


2007-06-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI: if body data was present for a request, any parameters
	in the query part of a URL were ignored. That's incorrect, they're
	just part of the data as well as the body data is. The body data
	takes preference though, it overrides any values for the same keys
	present in the query part of the URL.


2007-05-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_SYSTEM.file_content_as_string: crash if size of
	given file was 0.


2007-05-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_SIGNAL_SWITCH_ACCESSOR: removed invariant, gave strange
	crash on ISE. If set to global once, it works however (Patrick
	Ruckstuhl).


2007-05-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* eposix.ecf: works now out of the box when multithreading is
	enabled (Patrick Ruckstuhl).


2007-05-18  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release 3.0.

	* WINDOWS_SYSTEM: two new functions to retrieve the
	high-performance timer frequency and current count. Can be used
	for high-resolution timing (requested in March 2004 by Brian
	Heilig...).

	* EPX_MIME_PARSER: MIME parser parsed field Content-Disposition
	without stripping directory components from the filename
	parameter.

	* Two new email writing examples: writing HTML email, and writing
	a multipart/related email, with both HTML and text content.

	* EPX_MIME_EMAIL_HEADER.make_default: adds the MIME-Version field.

	* All C calls that are potentially blocking, are now marked as "C
	blocking" in ISE specific code. That means that a lot of the API
	classes now reside in spec/<compiler> directories.


2007-05-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTPS_URI_RESOLVER: new class (thanks Colin Paul Adams for
	noting it was missing).


2007-05-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* posix_syslog: possibility for format string vulnerability (DDJ
	March 2007) because second argument was actually a C format
	string. Everyone who uses syslog should upgrade to the new
	release.


2007-03-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI: better mechanism to detect if data is available in the
	QUERY_STRING environment variable or via stdin.

	* EPX_MIME_PART.append_to_string: only appends a Content-Length
	field if `auto_insert_content_length' is set to True as this is
	not appropriate in all cases, and did confuse at least my own MIME
	parser in some cases.

	* EPX_MIME_PARSER: if bodies inside a multipart body had a
	Content-Length, parsing stopped after such a body. Now such
	Content-Length fields are ignored.

	* EPX_CGI: don't write body when request method is HEAD.


2007-03-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI.if_modified_since: new feature to return value of
	If-Modified-Since header.

	* STDC_TIME: now conversion routine `as_dt_date_time' to return a
	Gobo DT_DATE_TIME object.

	* STDC_TIME: new creation routine make_from_dt_date_time, to
	initialize from a Gobo DT_DATE_TIME object.

	* EPX_MIME_PARSER: new creation routine make_from_string.


2007-03-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_FIELD_LAST_MODIFIED: new class.

	* EPX_CGI: error message + abort when CONTENT_LENGTH not set and
	method other than GET is called.


2007-03-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE.open_write: new feature.

	* Solaris: fixed library compile issue.

	* c_signal_handling.c: signal_switch is now of type EIF_OBJECT.

	* c_exit_handling.c: exit_switch is now of type EIF_OBJECT.


42007-03-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta 2.5.1.


2007-02-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_TCP_SERVER_SOCKET: don't set the SO_REUSEADDR option on
	Windows as it does something completely different: it screws up
	your system. Really. Read
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winsock/winsock/using_so_reuseaddr_and_so_exclusiveaddruse.asp and shiver.

	* ABSTRACT_TCP_SERVER_SOCKET.set_reuse_address: `enable' parameter
	was ignored, value was always set.


2007-02-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.close_on_execute: did nothing.


2007-01-27  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT.read_response_wit_redirect: new method to
	read a response and follow up on redirects until the redirects end
	(or 20 redirects have been processed).

	* EPX_MIME_PARSER: unlike the RFC 2617 as I read it Apache returns
	WWW-Authenticate with parameters separated by comma's. This is now
	handled correctly.


2007-01-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* socket multiplexing patch from Till G. Bay merged. This makes
	eposix usuable for Goanna without patches.

	* ABSTRACT_SOCKET/EPX_SOCKET now inherit from ABSTRACT_DESCRIPTOR
	and no longer contain file specific features.

	* EPX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR: generic descriptor code moved to new class
	EPX_DESCRIPTOR.

	* ABSTRACT_DESCRIPTOR: class with most functionality from
	ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR, but contains only descriptor specific
	functionality, not file descriptor
	functionality.


2007-01-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_TCP_CLIENT: default now raises an exception when a
	connection to a serve can't be opened (previously it returned not
	is_open), this is more consistent with how eposix works. Set
	continue_on_error to get the previous behaviour.

	* STDC_BASE: new feature `inherit_error_handling' to inherit
	error handling like raising an exception from another class.

2007-01-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XHTML_WRITER: new features set_onclick and script.


2006-11-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE.put_string: now supports writing of strings wtih %U
	characters. Strings are also used as buffers in Eiffel, it was a
	bit surprising that only C like strings could be written. This
	could have an impact on performance.


2006-11-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SUS_TEMPORARY_FILE: create temporary file based on mkstemp(), so
	filename is available.

	* STDC_TEMPORARY_FILE.name: no longer exported as not applicable.

	* STDC_FILE and ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR: they no longer use
	incompatible identifiers to refer to their name: it's simply name
	now, as inherited from Gobo's stream network. So rename filename
	and path to name. Old features marked as obsolete.


2006-11-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_PARSER: added some rudimentary cookie parsing, only
	name=value is parsed properly, all the other fields are in
	parameters, but not available yet through nice names, although it
	might appear that way.

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT: added features is_authentication_required,
	authentication_scheme and authentication_realm to help identify
	what authentication is required.


2006-11-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT: Added set_basic_authentication to include
	the authorization header in case the server uses basic
	authentication.


2006-11-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE_SYSTEM.write_string_to_file: new feature to write
	contents of a string to a file. File is always created.


2006-10-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_HEADER.set_content_type: new method.

2006-10-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_TCP_CLIENT: use make_secure to create an https connection to
	the server. Needs the openssl binary to create such connections.


2006-10-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE/ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.eof: made eof obsolete, so we
	are now fully Gobo compatible by using `end_of_input'.


2006-10-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_BUFFER: class invariant could fail under certain
	circumstances when an HTTP server used chunked encoding.


2006-09-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_EMAIL_HEADER.set_cc: new method

	* Fixed a nasty bug in FreeBSD socket handling. It seems sockets
	set EWOULDBLOCK even when data is returned for FreeBSD 5 and
	higher. So errno is now explictly reset when data is returned, so
	routines expecting errno to be set only on errors behave like
	expected.

	* Some Makefiles contained some constructs not supported by
	FreeBSD make.


2006-08-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI: support for PUT method.


2006-07-31  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Ugraded automake/autoconf to 1.9.6/2.6.


2006-07-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added all POSIX error codes to POSIX_CONSTANT, included EPIPE.

	* EPX_URI: obsolete, now use Gobo's UT_URI.

	* Removed long obsolete classes as ARRAY_HELPER, CHARACTER_HELPER
	and STRING_HELPER.


2006-07-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE.put_string contained a check instruction that failed
	if a UC_STRING was passed with a real Unicode character. Check
	instruction removed.


2006-07-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI: moved to separate directory eposix/src/epxc/cgi


2006-06-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER: now uses the stricter routines from
	XM_UNICODE_CHARACTERS for name and content validation. The
	corresponding routines in EPX_XML_ROUTINES have been made
	obsolete.


2006-06-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_PATH.directory_separator: exported to all.


2006-06-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI.is_valid_request_method: new feature which can return
	false in case the request method is not recognised. The EPX_CGI
	will return 405 in that case.


2006-06-05  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI.status: did not emit new line after header, so the next
	header effectively became part of the status reason.


2006-05-31  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_STRING_HELPER: uc_string_to_pointer and
	do_uc_string_to_pointer had an incorrectly specified precondition
	`not_prematurely_terminated'. This was due to a late minute fix
	due to some Gobo renames, it only affected release 2.4.

	* EPX_XML_WRITER: uses append_item_code instead of append_code due
	to rename in Gobo CVS.

	* EIF_OBJECT wasn't defined for Visual Eiffel when compiling the C
	binding.


2006-05-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release 2.4.


2006-05-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI: new feature `status' which can signal to the server
	what status code, response code, to return to the browser.

	* EPX_IMAP4_CLIENT: new feature fetch_header_and_flags.


2006-05-25  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI: has_key didn't initialise the key/value pair data
	structure which `value' and `raw_value' did.

	* EPX_MIME_PARSER: now parses most of the fields which contain a
	list of email addresses such as the from, to, cc and bcc fields.


2006-05-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XHTML_WRITER.img: features to add an image.


2006-05-18  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* same_string: fixed various unsafe STRING comparisons, thanks to
	Colin Paul Adams for the list.


2006-04-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* library.xaxce: SmartEiffel + msc required linking in the
	Advapi32.lib.


2006-04-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_IMAP4_RESPONSE_PARSER: Binc imap server included a flag that
	should not have been included in the FLAGS flag list.


2006-04-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta release 2.3.2.


2006-04-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_PARSER: support for Transfer-Encoding chunked.

	* EPX_MIME_PARSER.parse_body: does not take an argument
	anymore. Determining length of message body is now entirely based
	on the previously parsed header.

	* EPX_MIME_PARSER: now based on new parser.


2006-03-31  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_EXTENSION_FILTER: now accepts all directories and will
	recursive to any depth. Filenames must still match the filter
	though.

	* ABSTRACT_DIRECTORY.forth: when an extension filter was set, and
	recursive browsing was specified, directories were not recursived
	because they did not match the extension filter. Introduced the
	option validate_directory in ABSTRACT_PATH_FILTER to give a filter
	the option to accept directories, and not include them in the
	filter.

	* EPX_FILE_SYSTEM.browse_directory: now returns an EPX_DIRECTORY.

	* EPX_DIRECTORY: class equal to ABSTRACT_DIRECTORY. People should
	use this as I want to face out seeing ABSTRACT_XXXX in code
	outside of eposix.


2006-03-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CHARACTER_HELPER has been marked as obsolete. There's
	perfectly valid Gobo code to do this.


2006-03-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Gobo Eiffel Compiler support added. Use --with-compiler=gec.

	* src/capi/c_exit_handling.c and src/capi/c_signal_handling.c:
	used EIF_OBJECT to store a reference, changed that to the proper
	EIF_REFERENCE.


2006-02-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_TIME.is_valid_date_and_time returned True for a date and
	time after the maximum valid time that can be represented by an
	INTEGER in SmartEiffel. This was due to a compiler bug in
	SmartEiffel in my opinion and probably present in earlier versions
	as well.


2006-02-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR: seek features didn't reset eof,
	should always be False after a seek.


2006-02-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_SERVER: support for persistent and multiple open
	connections. It's not multi-threaded and a client can still block
	the server, but it will now serve multiple open connections.
	This caused a severe internal rewrite, many functions in
	EPX_HTTP_SERVER have moved to EPX_HTTP_CONNECTION. If you wrote
	custom servlets you will probably see many obsolete warnings. Most
	should still compile though.

	* EPX_HTTP_SERVER.make: does not start listening. You will have
	to call `listen_locally' or `listen_globally' to start listening
	on an interface.


2006-02-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_SERVER.send_file: when serving a file it now includes
	an ETag, supposedly a required field.


2006-02-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.status: now of type EPX_STATUS instead of
	ABSTRACT_STATUS.

	* EPX_HTTP_SERVER.add_file_expires_date: new feature that adds an
	Expires header for image files in order to improve performance
	with IE. Without this IE will retrieve reused images on a page
	multiple times.


2006-01-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added the --enable-threads flag to configure to compile the
	eposix C binding lib for use with a multi-threaded ISE Eiffel program.


2006-01-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta release 2.3.


2006-01-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* makelib.exe now generates multi-threaded libraries when
	compiling the eposix C bindings for ISE Eiffel and Microsoft C.


2005-12-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Fixed subtle code ordering problem when a maximum number of
	files was in place and this number was exceeded. At garbage
	collection time the `open_files' count could drop below zero. As
	the program really should be terminated at this point, this
	wouldn't be a problem, but if you have a giant retry handler, you
	might encounter this issue.


2005-11-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT: removed precondition
	post_data_content_type_recognized as this is not necessarily true
	(Colin Paul Adams).


2005-11-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CURRENT_PROCESS: new feature effective_user_name.


2005-11-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_SMTP_CLIENT: When reading capabilities should have used
	force_last (Colin Paul Adams).


2005-08-25  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* WINDOWS_CURRENT_PROCESS.user_name: returns name of user
	associated with current thread.


2005-08-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* WINDOWS_BASE: redefined raise_posix_error to get the error
	message from the Windows API GetErrorMessage() instead of the
	posix strmessage. The posix strerror() doesn't return anything for
	Windows specific error numbers.
	This is a bit annoying if you combine classes that don't
	descend from WINDOWS_BASE with ones that do. In that case make
	sure to undefine raise_posix_error on the classes that do not
	inherit from WINDOWS_BASE.

	* PAPI_UNISTD: posix_getgroups compared pointer to Void, should
	have been default_pointer (Andrea Rezzonico).


2005-08-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_DSML_V1_WRITER: class to write LDIF file in XML format,
	i.e. DSML v1. DSML v2 is the latest standard, but it's more
	complex and there are almost no examples.


2005-08-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Started LDIF parser. Does parse all LDIF files, but doesn't
	create a lot of AST.


2005-07-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE_SYSTEM.rename_to: when compiled with preconditions
	might set errno, so make sure errno is cleared just in case.

	* STDC_ERRNO.clear_all: normally one wants to reset both value and
	first_value at the same time before checking for errors.

	* STDC_ERRNO: first_value wasn't shared among all STDC_ERRNO
	objects. Like value it should be a global value.


2005-06-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_STRING_HELPER: incorrect postcondition in case the STRING
	contained a NULL character (Colin Paul Adams).


2005-06-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER.add_comment: didn't quote meta data properly.

	* EPX_XML_WRITER.add_attribute, add_ns_attribute,
	add_a_name_space: faster way of adding attributes to a very big
	XML document. Unlike set_attribute the attribute is written
	immediately to the stream, it cannot be changed.


2005-06-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.put_string: don't check for null
	characters anymore.

2005-05-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_TIME: new feature is_valid_date_and_time. Strengthened
	preconditions to make sure dates past 2038-Jan-19 03:14:08 UTC are
	not allowed.

	* EPX_MIME_PARSER didn't correctly validate dates which could lead
	to a precondition violation.


2005-03-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MAP_FIXED: FreeBSD 5.3 does not seem to have the MAP_FIXED
	define (reported by Frank J. Beckmann), unless some define is
	set. Not sure why that is, so MAP_FIXED is 0 now, if not
	defined. To be fixed properly.

	* POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR: new feature is_closed_on_execute to test
	if the descriptor closed on execute.


2005-03-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added precursor call to dispose routines. This seems to be
	required for ISE Eiffel.


2005-03-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release 2.2.


2005-03-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_URI_RESOLVER: sets name of last_stream to full URI.

	* EPX_IRC_CTCP: DCC talk support. Needs INTEGER_64 to work, so
	that rules out VisualEiffel 4.1 support for this part in eposix.


2005-02-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_line: could append %U characters
	in case non-blocking i/o was enabled (screw up with last change
	made on 2004-12-15).

	* EPX_IRC_CLIENT: NickServ support added.

	* EPX_IRC_CHANNEL: user tracking added.


2005-02-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* MIME parser/scanner were not deleted with "make clean".

	* eposix's C binding now compiles on Solaris, provided the
	-std=c99 flag is set.


2005-02-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Removed setting of _POSIX_SOURCE from all capi/*.h files.

	* All sapi/*.h files now define _XOPEN_SOURCE to 600.

	* All papi/*.h files now define _XOPEN_SOURCE instead of
	sometimes, or sometimes _POSIX_SOURCE. _POSIX_SOURCE seems to be
	unsupported when the -std=c99 flag is specified, at least Solaris
	10 doesn't want to compile such sources.


2005-02-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release 2.1.3.

	* SUS_ENV_VAR.set_value was still susceptible to a garbage
	collection that could make the set environment value invalid. Be
	aware that if you create a new SUS_ENV_VAR and set the same
	environment variable repeatedly, there will be a memory leak.

	* WAPI_WINDOWS.posix_createprocess: similar comparison to Void
	instead of default_pointer (Jocelyn).

	* STDC_FILE.attach_to_stream: required a_stream not Void, should
	be not default_pointer (Jocelyn).


2005-02-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR: new creation method make. Takes no arguments.

	* It seems Windows child processes inherit their socket handles by
	default. Turned this off, should perhaps become a feature if
	someone really needs it, but it looks more like a possible and
	exploitable security hole at the moment.


2005-01-27  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_BUFFER.put_string: off by one wrong variant in loop.

	* SUS_ENV_VAR.set_value was wrong. Argument should be a pointer to
	a memory area, but a string was passed that could become garbage
	collected.

	* PORTABLE_PATH.set_portable_path now reuses existing string
	again, because we're no longer freezing objects in memory with ISE
	Eiffel.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_string no longer reads directly to
	a string. Reading now takes a string copy. This to avoid calling
	eif_freeze in ISE Eiffel.

	* EPX_ARRAY_HELPER.pointer_array_to_pointer now returns a read-only
	pointer to the array (true for ISE Eiffel, but might become true
	for others as well). Modifications made on the C side are not
	reflected in the ARRAY.

	* EPX_ARRAY_HELPER.integer_array_to_pointer now returns a read-only
	pointer to the array (true for ISE Eiffel, but might become true
	for others as well). Modifications made on the C side are not
	reflected in the ARRAY.

	* EPX_STRING_HELPER.string_to_pointer now returns a read-only
	pointer to the string (true for ISE Eiffel, but might become true
	for others as well). Modifications made on the C side are not
	reflected in the STRING.

	* Removed freezing/unfreezing for ISE altogether. Used
	STDC_BUFFER for all memory management to avoid weird errors.


2005-01-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* PORTABLE_PATH.set_portable_path: reused an existing string, but
	this did not work in certain cases with ISE. Existing string was
	frozen (marked as unmovable for the gc) with ISE when passed to
	C. But when two such calls were done, I got a segment
	violating. Could not track it down, but problem disappeared when
	creating a new string. Perhaps freezing strings doesn't work after
	all...


2005-01-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_FTP_CLIENT: inherited from SAPI_IN, should have been
	EPX_NET_API in order to make it work on Windows.


2004-12-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_BODY_MULTIPART.make now needs header as argument.

	* EPX_MIME_BODY_MULTIPART.append_to_string: in case of more than
	one part, parts were not properly separated by a header.

	* EPX_MIME_PART.append_to_string: created wrong MIME multi part
	structure in case user had supplied a Content-Length field (no
	boundary was emitted) or in case it was called twice (because
	after the first call a Content-Length field was added).


2004-12-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_PART.append_to_string didn't append the boundary in a
	proper manner. So multi part MIME structures were incorrectly
	formatted if they did not end with a CR LF. In case they did, the
	CR LF became part of the boundary and was therefore stripped from
	the input. This affected EPX_MIME_PART.make_form_data for example.


2004-12-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_CLIENT.make_from_port: renamed to make_with_port.

	* EPX_HTTP_CLIENT: now shares same reply and socket handling code
	as EPX_SMTP_CLIENT/EPX_FTP_CLIENT.

	* EPX_SMTP_CLIENT: breaking change in open: parameters moved to
	correspending make_XXXX routines. Open now doesn't take any
	argument. Makes it slightly easier to reuse an SMTP connection and
	open/close it multiple times.

	* EPX_FTP_CLIENT: breaking change in open: parameters moved to
	correspending make_XXXX routines. Open now doesn't take any
	argument. Makes it slightly easier to reuse an FTP connection and
	open/close it multiple times.

	* EPX_REPLY_CODE: new class which abstracts the reply code logic
	implemented by FTP/HTTP/SMTP clients.


2004-12-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_IRC_CLIENT: first implementation of IRC client.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_line: now does blocking i/o if it
	has read the first character. Else you could end up reading
	partial lines. If you want truly non-blocking i/o string reading,
	use read_string instead of line reading.


2004-12-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Renamed EPX_TCP_CLIENT_BASE to
	EPX_TCP_CLIENT_WITH_REPLY_CODE_BASE.


2004-12-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta release 2.1.2.

	* EPX_MIME_FORM: new class, inherits from EPX_MIME_PART. Contains
	the make_form_data feature moved from EPX_MIME_PART. Use this
	class to create the result of HTML form submission to an HTTP
	server.

2004-12-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_FTP_CLIENT: commands didn't end with a CR LF, so didn't
	work against some servers (Colin Paul Adams).


2004-12-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_IP4_ADDRESS.make_from_components: didn't handle
	addresses which let to overflow of a signed 32 bit integer. Now it
	correctly does unsigned integer arithmetic (thanks to Colin Paul
	Adams).

	* POSIX_CURRENT_PROCESS.login_name: new definition, now seems to
	return a reliable login name, based on the effective user
	id. Feature getlogin retains the original definition, but is
	marked as obsolete and insecure.

	* POSIX_CURRENT_PROCESS.real_user: now returns the user based on
	the effective_user_id.

	* EPX_SMTP_CLIENT: send email through SMTP protocol.


2004-12-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_FTP_CLIENT: supports uploading, creating directories, and
	deleting files or directories.

	* EPX_FTP_CLIENT.name_list: new routine that returns just the file
	names present on the remote server.

	* EPX_SERVICE_STRINGS: new class, once strings when working with
	services.

	* EPX_FTP_CLIENT: only downloaded data from local FTP server (Colin
	Paul Adams).


2004-11-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_BUFFER.put_string: new routine to put a string into a
	buffer between two indexes.


2004-11-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.hash_code: returned invalid hash value
	(-1) if file descriptor was closed.


2004-11-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_DESCRIPTOR_SET.is_set: On FreeBSD could return False,
	because a value other than 1 seems to be considered False by
	SmartEiffel.


2004-11-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* New class EPX_PARTIAL_BUFFER: like STDC_BUFFER but has a count
	that can be less than capacity. Use when a buffer is only
	partially filled. You cannot peek_XXXX or poke_XXXX past count.


2004-11-18  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta release 2.1.1.


2004-11-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CURRENT_PROCESS.environment_variables: new feature that
	returns the names of all environment variables.

	* PAPI_UNISTD defined vfork, but a fork call was always
	done. Modern forks don't need vfork, feature removed.

	* STDC_CURRENT_PROCESS now inherits from ARGUMENTS. Previously it
	was ABSTRACT_CURRENT_PROCESS.


2004-11-01  Neal L. Lester <hidden@hidden.hidden>

	* EPX_INCREMENTAL_XML_WRITER: new class for incrementally writing
	XML. Does not need to be fully formed.


2004-10-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER.tag_depth: new method which returns how many tags
	have been started, but not stopped.


2004-08-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_URI.make had a precondition failure in stop_query if URL had
	an empty query, i.e. url that ended with a ? with no characters
	after it (thnx Neal Lester).


2004-08-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_SCANNER: scanner inadvertedly accepted fields with
	space names or a space between a name and a colon. Both are not
	acceptable. And I don't believe in being liberal what you accept.


2004-07-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_string: postcondition
	empty_only_when_blocked is only true when an exception is raised
	on a read error.


2004-07-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_CURRENT_PROCESS.current_time: new feature returning seconds
	since epoch.


2004-07-01  Raphael Mack

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_line: when nothing read, could try
	to remove a character from an empty string.


2004-06-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_EXEC_PROCESS for Windows: could wait indefinitely for
	process to exit if there was still unread data in stderr or
	stdout. Now these pipes are closed before waiting for the process
	to exit.


2004-05-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER.add_cdata: new routine to add data within a cdata
	section. Useful when adding data that is itself XML, because a
	CDATA section requires less quoting. So the resulting XML is
	smaller and will be processed faster.


2004-05-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_string: tag
	eof_only_when_nothing_read missed critical
	parentheses. Postcondition could fail, while everything was ok if
	you used non-blocking i/o.


2004-05-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SUS_UNIX_SERVER_SOCKET.accept: should work for non-blocking
	sockets.

	* EPX_SELECT.execute: possibly did not test all sockets in case
	you were selecting both for readable and writable sockets.


2004-05-11  Andreas Leitner  <nozone@sbox.tugraz.at>

	* EPX_XHTML_WRITER: form methods GET and POST must be lower-case
	according to spec.


2004-05-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SUS_CURRENT_PROCESS.nanosleep: new feature.

	* SUS_SYSTEM: new feature have_realtime_clock,
	real_time_clock_resolution and real_time_clock.

	* SUS_TIME: based on STDC_TIME, allows nano-second resolution for
	systems that support it. Because it uses a portion of the POSIX
	spec that is not widely supported, expect compile errors if you
	use it and your system doesn't have it.


2004-05-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_FTP_CLIENT: primitive FTP client, can only retrieve not yet
	upload.


2004-05-05  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_SOAP_WRITER.message: returned a ASCII string, but should
	have returned a UC_STRING instead.


2004-05-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_SERVICE.make_from_name_with_default: create a service,
	but provide a default port. Uses the given port if port not found
	in services, instead of rasing an exception like make_from_name
	does.


2004-04-24  Andreas Leitner  <nozone@sbox.tugraz.at>

	* EPX_XHTML_WRITER: more tags added


2004-04-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_EXEC_PROCESS.wait_for: now supports Suspend = False on
	Windows. This can be used to check if a process has terminated,
	forcibly or voluntarily, without waiting for that process to
	terminate.


2004-04-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_CURRENT_PROCESS.full_command_name: new feature that
	returns ARGUMENTS.command_name with the full path leading to the
	program.


2004-04-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_EXEC_PROCESS.wait_for: closes input pipe in case it is
	open. This was left to client, but you want that always really so
	the child process gets the proper end-of-input.


2004-03-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_SYSTEM.resolved_path was incorrect in case path
	was not a directory.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read and write routines did leave errno
	set when EWOULDBLOCK occurred. As this is not an error, but more
	of a status, errno should not be set in such cases.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.append did not properly abort when
	raise exceptions on error was turned off and a read failure had
	occured.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_line did not properly abort when
	raise exceptions on error was turned off and a read failure had
	occured.

	* makelib.exe didn't give an error message if the ISE_EIFFEL
	environment variable wasn't set.

	* STDC_PATH.parse now does a case-insensitive compare with the
	suffix, so you don't have to supply suffixes which only differ in
	case. I'm not aware of any platform where the case of the suffix
	mattered.


2004-03-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* s_select.h had the include order wrong (Chris Jones on NetBSD).

	* makelib.exe did want makelib.exe.cfg instead of makelib.cfg on
	Windows 98.


2004-03-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* EPX_MIME_FIELD_MESSAGE_ID has new create method make_unique,
	which attempts to create some random message id.

	* EPX_FACTORY now has two new features: system_info and
	current_process which return a reference to EPX_SYSTEM and
	EPX_CURRENT_PROCESS respectively. Use EPX_FACTORY when you don't
	want to pollute your name space.

	* Accessing the body in EPX_MIME_PART was always a bit akward. Now
	when creating the body, either text_body or multipart_body is set,
	that makes it easier to access or change a bodies context.

	* If EPX_MIME_PART was serialized by calling append_to_string the
	body contained an additional %R%N. But that is incorrect, the body
	should be exactly as specified.


2004-03-18  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* EPX_SENDMAIL now gives some access to the sendmail binary. Easy
	way to send email from within Eiffel while there is no SMTP
	support. But you need the sendmail program on your system or one
	that is mimicking sendmail like postfix.

	* EPX_MIME_EMAIL and EPX_MIME_EMAIL_HEADER added to make creation
	of RFC 2822 emails easier.


2004-03-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* WINDOWS_PAGING_FILE_SHARED_MEMORY didn't compile anymore,
	because its handle clashed with the handle from STDC_BUFFER.


2004-03-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* If an exception should be raised on error, can now be set per
	object. Previously it was a global setting. Use
	set_default_action_on_error, set_raise_exception_on_error and
	set_continue_on_error. Call raise_exception_on_error to ask if an
	EPOSIX class will raise an exception when a C call returns an
	error.

	* EPX_IMAP4_CLIENT allows to specify port via make_with_port.


2004-03-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* alpha release 2.1.0.

	* STDC_FILE.is_binary_mode_specification and
	STDC_FILE.is_text_mode_specification were incorrect.

	* STDC_FILE now inherits from KI_TEXT_INPUT_STREAM and
	KI_TEXT_OUTPUT_STREAM instead of just KI_CHARACTER_INPUT_STREAM
	and KI_CHARACTER_OUTPUT_STREAM.

	* In all examples replaced write_string by put_string. The
	put_XXXX are the default in Eiffel, so I'll probably phase out the
	write_XXXX methods.

	* STDC_FILE.put_character accepts a CHARACTER now instead of an
	INTEGER.


2004-03-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_URI.make didn't handle a "//" URI correctly, causing a
	precondition violation when parsing.


2004-03-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_IP_ADDRESS redefines is_equal so IP addresses can be
	compared for equality.


2004-03-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR now also inherits from
	KI_TEXT_OUTPUT_STREAM, previously only from
	KI_CHARACTER_OUTPUT_STREAM.

	* Support for the select() call on Unix and Windows. Allows
	synchronous i/o multiplexing.


2004-03-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.write did reset eof which it shouldn't do.

	* The --with-compiler option didn't work anymore for configure.

	* EPX_CURRENT_PROCESS now has a millisleep method that provides
	for millisecond resolution sleep on Windows and Unix. Due to timer
	issues, the minimum resolution can be higher than 1ms.


2004-02-25  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_PART has an initialization method that allows you to
	easily create a form data MIME message (RFC 2388).


2004-02-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT.get now sets the response code to 200 if the
	request was send successfully. You still need to call
	read_response to receive the actual response code from the server.


2004-02-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added class EPX_OPENSSL which uses the openssl program to
	connect to a server using a SSL/TLS session.


2004-02-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Changed EPX_HTTP_DYNAMIC_PATH such that a component must contain
	at least one character. I.e. previously /instance//show would be
	ok, but now it must be /instance/1/show or something like that.


2004-01-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* release 2.0.


2004-01-05  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* QNX doesn't set eof when STDC_FILE.read doesn't read the
	requested number of bytes. An exception was raised in that
	case. As it is harmless, behaviour is the same if we just ignore
	this case, the exception is no longer raised. It isn't our duty to
	check libc anyway.


2004-01-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* EPX_EXEC_PROCESS.all_arguments had a faulty postcondition that
	failed in case there were no arguments.

	* inet_ntop isn't available for Windows. I need it for IPv6, so
	IPv6, even if enabled on your Windows version, probably doesn't
	work. Will have to find a suitable replacement.

	* Socket programs didn't link with VisualEiffel for
	Windows, because the proper winsock library wasn't specified in
	eposix' library.xace.


2003-12-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI no longer emits output while it goes. The header is
	still written to the client as soon as possible, but the actual
	content, the XHTML body, is only written when the CGI is
	finished. This is thought to be more efficient than writing output
	while building the body.


2003-12-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_CGI now attempts to buffer output more than it used to do.

	* Added cookie support for EPX_CGI class. Cookies an be created
	via EPX_HTTP_COOKIE.


2003-12-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Release 1.9.5, beta release 2.


2003-11-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER.add_data (or puts) and set_attribute didn't
	handle UC_STRINGs which contained real unicode characters.


2003-10-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* POSIX_ASYNC_IO_REQUEST is now Unicode string safe.


2003-10-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_STRING_HELPER.string_to_pointer does now work correctly for
	UC_STRINGs. For SmartEiffel and VisualEiffel UC_STRING involve
	creating a new string. For ISE a new string is only created when
	the UC_STRING contains Unicode specific characters.


2003-10-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* Beta release 1.


2003-10-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_IMAP4_RESPONSE_SCANNER didn't recognize months after May.

	* STDC_TIME.make_utc_date_time did not calculate the unix time
	value correctly under certain occassions. Code entirely replaced
	and I do the calculation myself now.


2003-10-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Fixed postcondition bugs in STDC_TIME in set_date and
	set_date_time.


2003-10-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Upgraded to autoconf-2.57 and automake-1.7.7.


2003-10-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_DIRECTORY.forth was not correct after rewrite in
	1.9.3. Recursive browsing would end in a never-ending loop.


2003-09-27  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Writing a unicode string to ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR was
	incorrect for SmartEiffel.


2003-09-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* The GOBO_CC variable I was using should be equal to
	ISE_C_COMPILER. But it seems I used bcc where ISE used
	bcb. Corrected this. makelib now produces a lib with bcb in the
	name like libeposix_ise_bcb.lib.


2003-09-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_ROUTINES.is_valid_tag_name and as_valid_tag_name now
	fully implement the XML specification.


2003-08-27  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_IP4_ADDRESS.make_from_integer and make_from_loopback
	stored the IP address in host byte order.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_line's postcondition was
	incorrect. last_string could be empty due to removal of
	end-of-line character. In that case eof is still false.

	* ABSTRACT_IP4_ADDRESS.make_from_integer didn't set its value.

	* EPX_HTTP_SERVER now makes all parts in dynamic part available as
	"part <part name>". It also makes them available as just "<part
	name"> in case the field was not included in the form submission.


2003-08-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* alpha release 1.9.3.


2003-08-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Fixed a type cast bug in the C code for posix_reportevent, where
	anything other than Success events gave the dreaded The
	description for Event ID cannot be found.


2003-08-18  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE.put_string and ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.put_string now
	support Unicode strings. If the Unicode string contains actual
	Unicode characters, writing them is slower as they require a new
	string to be made to be written correctly.


2003-08-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Recursive directory browsing did not pass the directory name to
	a filter if one was set. Now it does, and if the filter returns
	False, the subdirectory is not descended into.

	* Added fix to STDC_TEMPORARY_FILE to garbage collect when a
	"Too many open files" is encountered.


2003-08-05  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Renamed abstract_EAGAIN to abstract_EWOULDBLOCK as this is
	clearer. But for today's unixes it's equal to EAGAIN.


2003-08-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* The eposix implementations of YY_BUFFER for its STDC_FILE and
	ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR now inherit from YY_FILE_BUFFER. This is
	possible, because they now inherit from
	KI_CHARACTER_INPUT_STREAM. This helped to remove a lot of code.

	* The ARRAY to pointer conversion now uses the same mechanism as
	STRING to pointer: the object is freezed, and has to be manually
	unfreezed.


2003-07-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_DIRECTORY.status can now return a not found
	status. This can happen when the directory contains a symbolic
	link to a non-existing file.

	* ABSTRACT_STATUS_PATH has two new methods: make_may_fail and
	refresh_my_fail. Both set the new found attribute. Use this to see
	if the status could be retrieved successfully or not, without
	raising an exception.

	* ABSTRACT_DIRECTORY now skips entries that do not exist when a
	filter is applied and the filter requires a status. Such entries
	can be symbolic links that point to files that do not
	exist. Status information is not available for such entries.

	Note that in other cases the start/forth loop can still return
	non-existing entries.


2003-07-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* WINDOWS_STATUS_PATH (stat() on paths) was incorrect on
	Windows. Windows doesn't like a trailing slash for
	directories. It's now stripped before we attempt to get the status
	of something.


2003-07-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* eposix's configure now autodetects the location of the
	SmartEiffel base.h file. This implies that earlier versions of
	SmartEiffel than 1.1 should work fine again. This only works on
	Unix. On Windows you still have to modify src/supportc/eiffel.h
	manually.

	* ISE signal handling now uses a frozen object. Experiment to see
	if I can get signal handling on Windows for safe. I catch Ctrl+C
	in a certain program and every now and then this leads to an
	exception.

	* Made signal handling safe. There was perhaps a corner case of a
	few CPU instructions where a signal could occur when things were
	not yet properly set up.

	* Now use EIF_OBJECT in C code instead of EIF_OBJ.


2003-07-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_SYSTEM.resolved_path_name did change the
	current directory when called.

	* STD_ERRNO now includes the error number when it looks like the
	error message was "Unknown error".

	* STD_ERRNO no longer inherits from STDC_BASE. STDC_BASE used
	STD_ERRNO and that lead to a form recursion that didn't look
	helpful.
	Cleaned up the code in this class somewhat.


2003-07-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE.read_string has a new definition: it no longer reads
	line, but only a stream of bytes without regard for the new line
	character. Use the new STDC_TEXT_FILE.read_line for line reading.

	* STDC_TEXT_FILE.chop_last_string is obsolete. new line characters
	are no longer present in last_string to remain compatible with Gobo.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_string does no longer do line
	reading, but just reads a certain amount of characters. This is
	new behaviour, and can potentially break code! But I think
	compatibility with Gobo was worth it.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_line is no longer obsolete (was
	made obsolete in alpha 1.9.1). It now implements the proper Gobo
	functionality. This is essentially the behaviour implemented in
	the last official release (1.6.x).
	But it's signature is changed, to code will still break. Gobo's
	read_line does not have an upper bound of the length of the
	line. Also last_string does not contain the new line characters,
	so chop isn't necessary.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR and STDC_TEXT_FILE now inherit from
	KI_TEXT_INPUT_STREAM (through EPX_TEXT_INPUT_STREAM). This implies
	that their put_string (and obsolete write_string) routines no
	longer take Void arguments.


2003-06-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR inherited four read routines from
	KI_CHARACTER_INPUT_STREAM. Those four are read_to_buffer,
	read_character, read_string and read_to_string. They expected
	blocking i/o. They are now renamed to non_blocking_read_character,
	non_blocking_read_string, etc. They will enable blocking i/o for
	the duration of the call. ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR has now two new
	routines read_character and read_string that have the correct
	contract for non-blocking i/o. This way, ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR
	behaves blocking when used as KI_INPUT_STREAM, and possibly
	non-blocking otherwise.


2003-06-27  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* UDP and unix stream sockets did not set is_open_read and
	is_open_write. This is needed, because descriptors now inherit
	from Gobo. By not setting those, you couldn't read or write to
	those sockets.


2003-06-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* It now seems that not is_terminated and is_pid_set are synonyms,
	perhaps will need to removing one of them.

	* Fixed invariant violation in classes that inherited from
	POSIX_DAEMON. Occurred when detach was called.

	* IMAP4 parser did not correctly set the flags when a message was
	retrieved, the flags were changed, and immediately after the flags
	for that message were retrieved again.

	* postcondition in EPX_URI.make_resolve could sometimes be false.


2003-06-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* alpha 1.9.2 released.

	* BeOS networking stuff works. Non-blocking sockets don't, have to
	call setsockopt it seems to do that.


2003-06-18  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Postconditions of creation routines in
	ABSTRACT_TCP_CLIENT_SOCKET and ABSTRACT_TCP_SERVER_SOCKET were
	susceptible to garbage collection interception.

	* Added creation routine open_by_name_and_port to
	ABSTRACT_TCP_CLIENT_SOCKET. With this routine you don't have to
	provide a resolved host name (EPX_HOST_PORT structure). Throws
	exceptions if it cannot resolve.


2003-06-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.write and do_read contained a wrong
	variant in its loop. Removed the variant. And indeed, that implies
	that there is no guarantee the loop ever terminates. Perhaps need
	to implement a counter and terminate after x times that we
	couldn't read/write anything??

	* EPX_XML_WRITER now quotes the ]]> sequence. I thought it was
	necessary only for compatilibity with SGML, but Xalan wants to see
	it quoted.

	* Removed EPX_XML_WRITER.insert_string as this routine is now in
	ISE (since 5.2).

	* Moved some once strings like QuoteAmp from EPX_XML_WRITER to
	EPX_XML_ROUTINES.


2003-06-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_BASE.exceptions is expanded again. Works now in SE 1.1rc2.

	* Moved as_valid_tag_name to EPX_XML_ROUTINES.


2003-06-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* Alpha release 1.9.1.


2003-06-05  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* Due to compilation errors with SmartEiffel, STDC_PATH now
	inherits from STDC_PATH_BASE where incompatibilities regarding
	is_equal and "<" are solved/hacked away.


2003-06-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* Moved certain queries that are XML specific, not EPX_XML_WRITER
	specific from that class into EPX_XML_ROUTINES. Useful for adding
	preconditions to routines that generate XML.


2003-06-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Correctly implemented Gobo's
	KI_CHARACTER_OUTPUT_STREAM.put_integer and put_double. The
	write_XXXX methods will become obsolete in the future.

	* Made STDC_FILE.put_character obsolete. It's meaning will change
	to conform to Gobo's put_character so it can accept CHARACTER
	instead of INTEGER.


2003-05-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_ENV_VAR.make is now exported to ANY as suggested by Marcio
	Marchini.


2003-05-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_STRING_HELPER.string_to_pointer for ISE didn't work when the
	garbage collector was disabled.


2003-05-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER indenting changed slightly. If an element had
	data which ended in a new line, indenting caused spaces to be
	added to the content of that element. Now no identing is done for
	an element that contains data. A closing tag is just appended to
	the data. An opening tag is also just appended to the data.


2003-05-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER.is_a_parent required the presence of an equality
	tester in tags.


2003-05-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* Added as_valid_tag_name to EPX_XML_WRITER to change a tag name
	to a valid XML tag name. Not really 100%, but at least it replaces
	spaces by a '-'.


2003-05-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_STRING_OUTPUT_FILE is now obsolete. Any eposix file class is
	is now a KI_OUTPUT_STREAM.

	* EPX_TEXT_INPUT_FILE is now obsolete. Any eposix file class is
	is now a KI_INPUT_STREAM.

	* src/epxs/imap code moved to src/epxc/imap4 as it is platform
	independent.

	* http tests moved to test_suite/epxc/.


2003-04-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE.read_character could violate a precondition in CHARACTER
	when fgetc returned -1 (EOF).


2003-04-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added decoders to decode MIME bodies for base64 and
	quoted-printable. Use EPX_MIME_BODY.as_plain_text to get the
	decoded bodies.

	* EPX_MIME_PART header stuff now moved to EPX_MIME_HEADER.


2003-04-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_MIME_BODY has a new routine: as_plain_text to return the
	body in 8bit text/plain format, as good as possible. For example a
	BASE64 encoded body is decoded in such cases.


2003-04-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Stopped parsing Received field for now, what a mess people place
	in there.

	* More improvements in MIME parser.


2003-04-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_TEMPORARY_FILE.make didn't set is_open_read and
	is_open_write properly.


2003-04-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* WINDOWS_STATUS_PATH had incorrect time fields. It seems to
	change depending on daylight saving times. A lot of people seem to
	know this bug, except Bill Gates. Another couple of hours lost,
	because of a Windows bug.

	* New method STDC_TIME.to_dos_seconds to change the seconds to an
	even number.

	* STDC_TIME now has methods to accept a broken down date or time
	in UTC format: make_utc_date, make_utc_date_time and
	make_utc_time. Employs some trickery, might not work correctly!

	* STDC_TIME has now the proper preconditions to check if you
	actually called to_local and to_utc.

	* STDC_TIME has now status if time is in UTC or local time:
	is_utc_time and is_local_time.

	* New method STDC_BUFFER.append_to_string.


2003-04-12  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Removed FILE_FLAG_POSIX_SEMANTICS when opening files for Windows
	EPX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR. Certain files would just not open with
	it. No idea why.


2003-04-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* non-blocking support for sockets under Windows added.

	* Added sequential http server in EPX_HTTP_SERVER. Besides files
	it can call servlet, see EPX_HTTP_SERVLET. Looks fairly complete
	and robust, but still a work in progress.


2003-04-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT has methods for delete and post.

	* EPX_MIME_FIELD_CONTENT_TYPE.value had the subtype and type
	components reversed.


2003-04-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_line and last_line are
	obsolete. read_string and read_character can now safely be mixed
	with read.


2003-04-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Fixed "bug" in EPX_URI path resolving. It seems that ISE's
	ARRAY.resize operator does not lower `upper' if `upper' is less
	than requested. If ISE did that, the code would be correct.

	* STDC_PATH.is_absolute and STDC_PATH.is_resolved added.


2003-04-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE now inherits from KI_CHARACTER_INPUT_STREAM and
	KI_CHARACTER_OUTPUT_STREAM as well.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR now also inherits from
	KI_CHARACTER_OUTPUT_STREAM
	(through EPX_CHARACTER_IO_STREAM).

	* Fixed bug in not setting SO_REUSEADDR properly in
	ABSTRACT_TCP_SERVER_SOCKET.


2003-04-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_TCP_SERVER_SOCKET.accept supports non-blocking sockets.

	* Started on EPX_HTTP_SERVER


2003-04-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* alpha release 1.9.0


2003-03-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_SIGNAL_SWITCH.dispose did access other objects in its
	dispose. ISE Eiffel does not allow that.


2003-03-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Windows EPX_EXEC_PROCESS now creates new processes with the
	CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP flag. Without this flag, a Ctrl+C would
	shut down any children as well (but not their children it
	seems). I assume the new behaviour is more Unix like, but still
	have to test it.


2003-03-22  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* HTTP client code made available at EPX level, so should work
	under Windows as well.


2003-03-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Fixed bug in POSIX_EXEC_PROCESS: it opened both a file
	descriptor and a stream, but both the stream and descriptor could
	be closed, because both were owner. Could lead to weird problems.


2003-03-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Detected a glaring error in my postconditions that check
	resource accounting. They do not work when garbage collecting is
	enabled. A sweep can actually decrease the number of open
	resources, the behaviour is actually unpredictable. New routines
	test if the gc is enabled or not, before testing the
	postcondition. This affected STDC_BUFFER and STDC_FILE.


2003-03-18  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_DIRECTORY.forth_recursive did not ensure its
	postcondition in certain situations.


2003-03-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added routines set_blocking_io and supports_nonblocking_io to
	ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.


2003-03-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Windows support for TCP sockets, client/server, finished. UDP
	coming shortly.

	* SUS_SOCKET_ADDRESS is now obsolete. Use EPX_HOST_PORT instead.


2003-03-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Started to add Windows TCP/IP support.


2003-02-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR now inherits from
	KI_CHARACTER_INPUT_STREAM. This should make a file descriptor
	plug-compatible with Gobo. STDC_FILE will follow.


2003-02-20  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_EXTENSION_FILTER inherited from EPX_CURRENT_PROCESS. No idea
	why. Removed.


	* STDC_PATH.is_equal implementation seems to be wrong, at least
	for ISE 5.2 on Windows. I now make sure I just compare real
	STRINGS.


2003-02-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Unix domain sockets work, see SUS_UNIX_SERVER_SOCKET and
	SUS_UNIX_CLIENT_SOCKET.

	* Added SUS_IP6_ADDRESS, IPv6 should be fully supported now.


2003-02-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added file_content_as_string method in ABSTRACT_FILE_SYSTEM: given a
	file name, returns its contents as a STRING.


2003-02-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* license changed to Eiffel Forum Version 2, see
	forum.txt. License is now FSF (GPL) and OSI (Open Software
	Initiative) compatible.


2003-02-10  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Renamed EPX_SINGLETON.the_singleton to just singleton.


2003-02-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added shutdown functions to SUS_TCP_SOCKET.

	* Added local_address and remote_adddress features to
	SUS_TCP_SOCKET.

	* Marcio Marchini reported a problem with the latest
	lcc. Apparantly it does not have PWIN32_FIND_DATA. Fixed this in
	w_windows.h and w_windows.c with replacing it by PWIN32_FIND_DATAA.


2003-02-07  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* WINDOWS_CHILD_PROCESS.is_pid_valid was incorrect, removed.

	* Added EPX_POINTER_HELPER.posix_pointer_to_integer to convert a
	pointer to an integer. Couldn't find a portable solution for this.

	* EPX_POINTER_HELPER.posix_pointer_add made obsolete as every
	POINTER class now supports the "+" operator.

	* EPX_POINTER_ADD is renamed to EPX_POINTER_HELPER. Previous class
	made obsolete.


2003-02-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added SUS_TCP_SERVER_SOCKET for server side of tcp
	connections. Using `listen_by_address' and `accept', server side
	sockets are now working.

	* SUS_TCP_SOCKET has been rewritten, use SUS_TCP_CLIENT_SOCKET
	now. This breaks existing code, sorry.

	* Verified that UDP works. Just create a SUS_SERVICE with protocol
	"udp" and you're fine. There is an SUS_UDP_CLIENT SOCKET, but
	currently it does not differ from SUS_TCP_CLIENT_SOCKET.

	* It is believed that the issues regarding a moving garbage
	collector with ISE Eiffel are now solved. Would like to get the
	comments of real experts on my trick though. Thanx to Andreas
	Leiter who `invented' it, he saw Eric Bezault doing something in
	XM_EXPAT_API that lead him to the idea now implemented in eposix.


2003-02-05  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.attach_to_fd now has a second
	parameter. This breaks existing code, sorry.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.close is now slightly stricter: it must
	actually be the owner, before it closes the file.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR now inherits from STDC_HANDLE as
	well. I'm well on my way to have all handle based stuff inherit
	from STDC_HANDLE, should make resource management and resource
	control very robust.

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_loop_disabled removed. I didn't
	seem to use it after I had a real read_string in this class and it
	requires a potentially expensive status call to disable it in many
	times.

	* EPX_STRING_HELPER.make_with_capacity has been made
	obsolete. STRING.make is now portable.


2003-02-05  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* official release 1.6.1.

	* Slight peformance improvement for VisualEiffel. Strings now
	allocate with capacity.

	* Now expects base.h in SmartEiffel 1.1 beta location.


2003-01-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER.start_ns_tag allows name_space = Void or empty.


2003-01-18  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* official release 1.6.0.

	* Some changes to the C glue code so it compiles on SunOS 5.8.


2003-01-14  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Some changes to the tests so they run better on cygwin.


2003-01-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* release candidate 1.5.6

2003-01-09  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.fd was also exported to none, it's now
	made available. But was with `stream', you generally shouldn't use
	it.

	* STDC_FILE.stream was only exported to
	ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR. As there is no reason to hide it, it's
	exported to ANY now.


2003-01-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_STACK made obsolete. Use Gobo's DS_STACK instead.


2002-12-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* SEM_VALUE_MAX is UINT, so can be negative with Eiffel's INTEGER,
	and actually it is on FreeBSD. Now a positive value is returned.


2002-12-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* beta 1.5.5.


2002-12-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added preconditions to STDC_FILE that file must be closed before
	allowed to open it again.


2002-12-11  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE.make_owner is obsolete, use become_owner instead.

	* STDC_FILE now inherits from STDC_HANDLE. This means stricter
	preconditions, for example to become owner, you must not be the
	owner already.

	* STDC_BUFFER now inherits from STDC_HANDLE.

	* Wrote an STDC_HANDLE class for managing handles like streams,
	file descriptors and memory pointers. Handles can be owned, owned
	handles are automatically closed on dispose.


2002-11-30  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added a work-around to EPX_CGI. My change to use UC_STRING in
	EPX_XML_WRITER cause a postcondition violation in UC_STRING when
	you write it to an eposix STDC_FILE or POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR. You
	shouldn't do that at this moment...

	* ABSTRACT_STRING_HELPER.insert_character is made obsolete. Itdoes
	not work in combination with an UC_STRING and ISE 5.1. Use Gobo
	routines for it. I'll attempt to phase out all my vendor specific
	code in favor of the Gobo routines.

	* Fixed fork bug. When passing a POSIX_FORK_ROOT to
	POSIX_CURRENT_PROCESS.fork, the child had status is_terminated, so
	when calling wait_for for that POSIX_FORK_ROOT, you got a
	precondition violation. Now POSIX_FORK_ROOT correctly reflects a
	successful fork.

	* Resolved BeOS issues. Added emulation for realpath, so more SUS
	code will work. Sockets don't work as BeOS does not treat sockets
	as file descriptors. Sorry, maybe in another version I can come up
	with a workaround.


2002-11-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* alpha 1.5.4

2002-11-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Removed FILE_FLAG_POSIX_SEMANTICS flag when creating files
	through a file descriptor on Windows. File creation would fail in
	certain cases when running in a cygwin shell.


2002-11-25  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Uwe Sander reported that w_limits.h did not compile with lcc, as
	lcc didn't have the same LIMITS.H as Windows had. Definitions
	copied from VC++ include files.

	* EPX_XML_WRITER.xml is now obsolete, use as_uc_string and
	as_string to get either an UC_STRING or a STRING.

	* EPX_XML_WRITER now based on UC_STRING, so can produce full
	Unicode XML.


2002-11-25  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* alpha 1.5.3.


2002-11-21  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Fixed bug in ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_string. Could return
	eof, even when there was something read. Happened when the last
	line did not end with a '%N' character.

	* ABSTRACT_STATUS.change_time is obsolete, use status_change_time,
	more clear else confusing with modification_time.

	* For some reason makelib.exe used an environment variable EIFFEL5
	on Windows. I've changed that to ISE_EIFFEL. Thanks to Andreas
	Leitner to spot this.


2002-11-16  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* For non-recursive directory browsing, ABSTRACT_DIRECTORY.status
	returned the same status after the first call for all items.

	* STDC_PATH.parse failed when a suffix was larger as the filename
	it self.

	* STDC_PATH.make_expand failed when an empty path was passed.

	* Precondition added to both creation routines of STDC_PATH that
	argument may not be Void.


2002-11-15  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* ABSTRACT_STRING_HELPER.split_on did not work correctly with
	ISE. Problem wasn't noticed because of bug in precondition. Code
	now tries to workaround a wierd ARRAY implementation.


2002-11-08  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Renamed EPX_XML_WRITER.set_name_space to set_a_name_space.


2002-11-02  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* alpha 1.5.2.

	* Memory allocated tracking for STDC_BUFFER should now also work
	when the object is disposed.


2002-11-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Lots of work on ownership of streams and file descriptors
	including correct increasing and decreasing count of open files
	even on dispose. So open file counting should now work in all
	cases.

	* Fixed bug in ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.read_string. Could read
	after eof in assert_end_of_line_read.

	* Not applicable commands in STDC_TEMPORARY_FILE are no longer
	exported.


2002-10-31  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Fixed bug in URI resolving, someone referred me to
	http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/issues.html#003-relative-query,
	an interesting page indeed. The bug was in the specs, my code
	implemented the spec correctly.


2002-10-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Fixed another invariant bug in STDC_FILE, opening a non-existing
	file would violate it. Again that that I detected by moving more
	of my tests to getest. Seems my old tests were pretty
	complete. Hope to complete the conversion soon, so we can avoid
	these kind of bugs in releases, even if it is just an alpha.

	* It seems SmartEiffel added more stuff to their top heavy GENERAL
	class. Had to change pi in EPX_EXEC_PROCESS to procinfo.

	* The wapi directory and its contents were missing in the 1.5.x
	release, so windows wouldn't work well, even after adding
	makelib.exe. This release has been tested on Windows.


2002-10-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added listen_by_address to SUS_TCP_SOCKET. No accept() yet. It
	also seems I need to split SUS_TCP_SOCKET in a client and server
	side as listen_by_address and connect_by_address cannot used
	interchangeably, especially not when accept() or select() or so
	will be added.

	* Converted more tests to getest. Boring work.

	* Function mkfifo was disabled, because p_stat.h didn't include
	config.h.


2002-10-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* alpha release 1.5.1.

	* at_exit handling implemented for VisualEiffel. Was already
	supported for the other Eiffel compilers.

	* Uwe Sander <usander@onlinehome.de> was really quick in reporting
	back an error in STDC_FILE. A last minute change compared a
	POINTER to Void, and that doesn't work... Unfortunately, not all
	my tests were ported to Gobo yet, so I hadn't detected that.

	* Uwe also reported that makelib.exe was missing.

2002-10-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Created interim release 1.5.0. I didn't want to continue on the
	1.1.x interim release branch, because there have been breaking
	changes.


2002-10-23  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_FILE.attach_to_stream now does not own the stream, just
	like POSIX_FILE_DESCRIPTOR does. An unowned stream is not really
	closed when close is called or the object is garbage
	collected. This fixed a bug in EPX_CGI where the program would
	crash (receive SIGTERM) as soon as it closed its stdout
	stream. This occurred because it inherited from
	STDC_CURRENT_PROCESS that used attach_stream to access the
	standard streams.


2002-10-19  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_XML_WRITER.set_attribute (was XML_GENERATOR) does no longer
	accept a ':' in an attribute name, use set_ns_attribute instead.


2002-10-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* EXP_CGI.cgi_data changed to a DS_HASH_TABLE. You have to use
	Gobo's iterators to loop over the items.


2002-10-04  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Line endings in EPX_XML_WRITER are now just a single %N
	character instead of a %R%N.


2002-10-03  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* New class EPX_HTTP_10_CLIENT (derived from EPX_HTTP_CLIENT) can
	retrieve data from an http server.

	* Rewrite of EPX_MIME_PARSER complete. Should now be able to parse
	any MIME message. Not all standards are supported, especially
	international character sets, base-64 encoding and such, but
	that's coming.


2002-10-01  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added parse_authority to EPX_URI to split authority into host,
	port and user info parts.


2002-09-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Changed definition of trim in ABSTRACT_STRING_HELPER. It's now a
	command, and trims the given string. Function probably not used
	much, because it removed all white space instead of just trimming
	it.

	* Added is_streaming and set_streaming to ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR
	to influence optimizations in read that determine if an attempt is
	made to read the requested number of bytes, or just do with what's
	available. Also useful for clients to make a distinction between
	stuff that's always there like disk files, and stuff that is
	currently streaming in over the network.

	* Added read_line to ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR to read something up
	to %N. This routine can be mixed with the read call, unlike
	read_character and read_string which never should be mixed with
	read.


2002-09-24  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added -mt option to makelib to produce an eposix library that
	can be used in an ISE Eiffel program that has been compiled with
	the multithreaded option. I don't think eposix is thread-safe,
	call it only from the main thread. And this works only with the
	MSC compiler.


2002-09-17  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Two new classes that enhance interoperability with Gobo:
	EPX_FILE_BUFFER and EPX_CHARACTER_BUFFER.


2002-09-13  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added start_ns_tag to start a tag with an explicit name space.


2002-09-06  Berend de Boer  <berend@pobox.com>

	* Added set_ns_attribute to EPX_XML_WRITER to set an attribute
	with a name space.

	* Added set_name_space to EPX_XML_WRITER.

	* Added class EPX_SOAP_WRITER, based on EPX_XML_WRITER, to
	generate SOAP messages with some confidence that the output is
	valid.

	* Slightly optimized EPX_XML_WRITER.


2002-08-29  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* arg_max, open_max, stream_max and tzname_max have been given
	more descriptive names. This was prompted by the fact that ISE
	does net let you implement a deferred routine with an external
	one, a trap I fell in again.


2002-08-28  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* Another reshuffling of the configure code. I finally have
	eiffel.m4, it really starts becoming something.

	* Added ABSTRACT_SYSTEM class with properties that are common
	between WINDOWS_SYSTEM and POSIX_SYSTEM. Use EPX_SYSTEM to pick
	the lowest common denominator. The Windows one know also returns
	the uname queries, quite useful for version and service pack
	checking for example.


2002-08-27  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* XML_GENERATOR renamed to EPX_XML_WRITER. So it now has the
	proper prefix, and it really didn't generate things, you had to do
	that.


2002-08-26  Berend de Boer  <berend@dellius.nederware.nl>

	* XML_GENERATOR can now generate XML fragments, use make_fragment
	or make_fragment_with_capacity to initialize properly.


2002-08-06	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* c_substring method added to STDC_BUFFER, copies substring up to
	requested index, but also stops when '%U' is encountered.

	* c_substring_with_string added to STDC_BUFFER. As c_substring,
	but uses an existing string.


2002-08-02	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* Converted to latest autoconf/automake. configure.in renamed to
	configure.ac


2002-07-23	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_BUFFER realloc method now obsolete. Often I used two names
	for a routine, to help people making the transition from the C
	API. I knew it was bad, because when redefining a feature, you
	really have to redefine two names, but I didn't know a better way
	then. Now I do: the solution was easy, make the POSIX name
	available as an obsolete name. I will slowly be converting those
	abbreviated POSIX names to obsolete names in the coming time.


2002-07-23	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* POSIX_MEMORY_MAP now inherits from
	ABSTRACT_MEMORY_MAP. ABSTRACT_MEMORY_MAP inherits from
	STDC_BUFFER.


2002-07-18	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* Lothar Scholz <llothar@web.de> asked for shared memory on
	Windows. I needed something like this myself, so there is now a
	WINDOWS_PAGING_FILE_SHARED_MEMORY class. I also implemented the
	first abstractions in ABSTRACT_MEMORY_MAP. Creating maps is not
	portable yet.
	Use POSIX_MEMORY_MAP and POSIX_SHARED_MEMORY to achieve the same
	effect on POSIX.


2002-07-17	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* EPX_URI class added for URI parsing.

	* split_on ensure strengthened. Now also works when passed a void
	string.


2002-07-15	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* makelib.exe tool now generates the same filenames as the Unix
	ones: uses underscore instead of dash and uses all lowercase.

	* lcc compiles again, it just missed EVENTLOG_SECURITY.


2002-07-12	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* I finally got around to make string_to_pointer more secure. It
	was potentially unsafe with ISE with garbage collection
	enabled. Perhaps VE and SE should also be fixed??

	* Windows library can currently not be compiled with lcc. It seems
	lcc is missing some NT stuff.

	* Implemented gettimeofday function in SUS_TIME_VALUE.


2002-07-11	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* Created ULM_LOGGING, a platform independent class to do logging
	based on the ULM concept. See
	http://www.hsc.fr/gul/draft-abela-ulm-05.txt for details. See
	test_suite/sus/ulm/test_ulm.e for examples.
	Handlers are avaible for both Unix (syslog) and Windows (NT/XP)

	* append_integer routine added to ABSTRACT_STRING_HELPER.


2002-05-26	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* SUS_HOST used .clear to clear aliases, but unfortunately, this
	was not supported by SmallEiffel, clear_all seems to be
	universally available.


2002-05-25	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* Created interim release 1.1.2

	* Andreas Scholz notified me that precompiling the latest interim
	release didn't work well with ISE. This release should do better.

	* According to the latest Gobo conventions, cluster.xace is now
	called library.xace.

	* Improved the speed and memory requirements of simple recursive
	directory browsing somewhat by employing some caching in
	full_name. The find utility is still a factor 2 faster...

	* ABSTRACT_DIRECTORY has two new queries: is_dot and is_dotdot
	which return true if if the filename ends with a "." or ".."
	respectively.

	* Fixed memory leak bug in
	ABSTRACT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR.assert_valid_buffer. It allocated new
	memory in certain cases without releasing the old. This was
	because the allocate and allocate_and_clear features of
	STDC_BUFFER were publicly visible, now they're only valid in
	object construction calls.

	* Portable path also no longer creates a new path, but overwrites
	the old one. Might have interesting effects on your code if you
	didn't clone...


2002-05-22	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* SUS_HOST has a found parameter which let you determine if the
	host was found or not. Before it just generated an exception.


2002-05-10	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* Created interim release 1.1.1

	* Actually tested distribution made by autoconf's make dist.


2002-03-09	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* fixed bug in ABSTRACT_FILE_SYSTEM.force_remove_directory. Called
	directory.close, but directory was already closed, because
	behaviour changed when adding recursive looping.

	* EPX_CGI error handling didn't output a header if no CGI header
	was written. Now it attempts to detect such cases and output a
	plain text header.


2002-03-01	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* fix for p_limits.c, test if PATH_MAX was defined. With this fix
	eposix should compile out of the box on QNX 6.1. Thanks to Daniel
	Solaz <dsolaz@lepidoptero.com>


2002-02-24	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* STDC_TIME has now queries to let some one know if you have
	called to_utc or to_local. Thanks to Lothar Hansche
	<lothar.hansche@detewe.de> who reported this oversight.

	* conversion to GNU build environment essentially complete. My
	build environment will also move to this.


2002-02-23	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* posix_pointer_advance changed according to suggestion of
	H. Erdbrgger" <he@softpoint.de>

	* started convertion to use GNU automake, libtool and others.

	* History file has now become a GNU ChangeLog file.


2002-02-05	Berend de Boer	<berend@pobox.com>

	* release 1.0.0 of eposix
