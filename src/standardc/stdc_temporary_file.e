			-- with ISE Eiffel 5.3, the limit was 50 files open at a
			-- given time. This limit is defined in _nfile.h and the
			-- constant is _NFILE_.
			-- With Microsoft C the limit was 512 files. It is defined in
			-- STDIO.H and the constant is _NSTREAM_.
			-- With lcc the limit seems to be 40 files.
