indexing

	description:

		"Lexical analyzer input buffer which can detect separation between header and body of request, and not read more than necessary to prevent blocking. It also supports reading just Content-Length bytes from the input stream and it supports Transfer-Encoding: chunked. Especially supporting the latter made this class quite unreadable. My humble apologies."
